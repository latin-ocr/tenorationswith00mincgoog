THE ROMAN CONSTITUTION 65

in the management of public affairs 3 and also a large num-
ber of subordinates paid by the state —such as scribeS, sooth·
sayers‚ engineers‚ interpretem, and messengerS.

When Cicero wrote, Difficile est dictu, Quirites, quanto in Evils of
oa'io simus apud exteras nationes, he stated no more than the zmffi„
simple fact. The condition of the provinces during the later ‘¹0¹²-
republic was one of unspeakable misery. Regarded as con-
quered subjects, and therefore legitimate prey, the provincials

were plundered remorselessly by the governor and his subordi-
nates on the one hand, and the Roman tax-sarmers and usurers
on the other. After the governor’s term of office had expired‚
a province could bring an action against him at Rome, but his
conviction was a difficult matter, and if secured, had but little

bearing upon the condition of the province itself. The dis·
tress of the provinces grew steadily greater until the advent
to power of Julius Caesar inaugurated a system of reform.
