TEN ORATIONS OF CICERO 41

he followed the fortunes of Pompey. After PharsaluS, however, , ..
he withdrew to Mytilene, and tranquilly devoted himself toqthe

Gaius MarcelluS‚ brother of the exile, threw himself in entreaty
at Caesar's feet, and the entire senate rose to second the
appeal. Caesar, after recounting the offenses of Marcellus
against him, said that he should not allow his personal resent-
ment to outweigh the wishes of the senate. The question was
then put to a formal vote. When Cicero’s turn came, he arose,

and its tone is strangely at variance with the sentiments which
Cicero expressed after Caesar's death. But its eulogy could
not have seemed so inordinate to those who heard it as it does
to us who read it in the light of conditions vastly changed from
the days when massacre and proscription were the usual ac-
companiments of victory. The humanity of Caesar, remarkable
in any age, was indeed a new experience to men who had
known the atrocity of a Sulla. Cicero's hopes of a restored
republic and his exuberant enthusiasm for the generous victor
may well have been at this time sincere. x
