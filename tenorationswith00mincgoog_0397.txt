PRO ARCHIA POETA 345

2 5. de vita: at tlte rz‘sk of their lives.
26. periculorum, laborum: objective genitiveS.
29. Achillis tumulum: on the promontory of Sigeum at the

western entrance of the Hellespont are several mounds, the largest ’

of which has been known from the most ancient times as the tomb
of Achilles, and the one adjacent to it as that of his friend PatrocluS.
The excavations made in these and some of the other hillocks have,
however, furnished no evidence that they were barrows heaped up
over graves, like the famous Mound of Marathon.

1. Magnus: i..e Cn. Pompeius. There is an adroit compliment
to Pom pey in the comparison of Noster hic Magnus with magnus ille
Alexander.—Theophanem: he was afterwards one of Pompey's
chief advisers during the civil war3 in fact, through his influence with
Pompey he had a large share in causing the outbreak of the war.

3. civitate donavit: sometimes the general was given by
special enactment the right to bestow citizenship3 sometimes he
usurped it as a prerogative.

4. milites: common soldiers. The meaning is that they could
not appreciate the learning and genius of Theophanes because of
their own lack of culture.

5. eiusdem laudis: i.e. thepraise bestowed upon Pompey in
the writings of Theophanes.

6. si non: see note on p. 157, 1. 17.

7. potuit: A. 517. c; B. 304. 3. a: G. 597. R. 33 H. 583.

8. petentem: with conditional force.

9. quem: refers to Sulla.

10. de populo: of tlte common people, os tlte haser sort. — quod
epigramma: an epigram which.

11. alternis versibus longiusculie: probably refers to the
elegiae distich, in which hexameter and pentameter verses alternate.
Greek and Roman epigrams were commonly in this meter. Cicero
means that the only literary merit the composition possessed lay
in its having a metrical form.

12. vendebat: Sulla was conducting a sale of the confiscated
property of those whom he had proscribed.

14. duxerit: subj. in a relative causal clause—tamen: i.e.
despite the fact that he was malus poeta.

15. expetisset, impetravisset: apodoses of conditions con-
trary to fact, the protases being implied.

18. Cordubae: a little later this city produced a more famous
poet in Lucan, who wrote an epic on the struggle between Pompey
and Caesar.
