theatrical representations or gladiatorial shows given in honor of the
deceased by his relativeS.

23. lamentis: i.e. those of women hired for this purpose. They
sang a dirge in the procession. —laudationibus: see note on
p.176,l.19.

26. clariss—imorum virorum formas: i.e. the imagines of the
ancestors of Clodius.

27. mortem eius: used for eum mortuum for the sake of paral-
lelism with vita.

28. in quo . . . damnata: i.e. the Curia. Cf. p. 190, ll. 7, 8.

1. resciderat: i.e. by banishing their author he had annulled
the measures taken against the Catilinarians.

2. bona diripuerat, domum incenderat: after the passage of
the bill exiling him, Cicero was regarded as an outlaw‚ his property
was confiscated, his house on the Palatine burned, and his villas at
Tusculum and Formiae plundered. But upon his return, his property
was restored to him, and compensation for his losses was granted
him from the public treasury.—liberos‚ coniugem: cf. Cic. Sest.
24. 54, Vexabatur uxor mea, liberi ad necem quaerebantur.

4. *magistratuum: probably an exaggerated reference to the
attacks on SestiuS, F abriciuS, and Caecilius. See p. 178, 11. 18-22.

6. domum . . . incenderat: when the work of restoring Cicero's
house on the Palatine was begun, Clodius at the head of an armed
band attacked and drove off the workmen, and set fire to the adjoin-
ing house of Quintus Cicero.

9. capere: cf. p. 149, l. 15.

11. incidebantur: i.e. as if they had already been passed.—
leges . . . addicerent: it has been generally supposed that Cicero
refers to Clodius' proposal to allow freedmen to vote in all the
tribes instead of only the four city tribes. As each tribe had one
vote, determined bya majority of the tribe, the proposed change
would have greatly increased the political influence of the freedmen.
It is possible, however, that Cicero insinuates that Clodius intended
a general emancipation of the slaves. See note on legum, p. 176, l. 8.
