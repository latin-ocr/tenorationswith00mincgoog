the last four years of his life to produce the richest fruit of his
many-sided genius·

It was during these years that he reproduced the philoso-
phies of Greece‚ and with the formerly rigid Latin almost out-
Hellenized his models in delicate beauty and pliant grace. It
would be useless to claim for him any originality of philosophi-
cal thought, but on passing through the alembic of his mind the
grand thoughts of the old Greeks appear in a new and charm-

and conclusion3 an exalted dignity of tone and rhythm, the
employment of sonorous words and cadenced phrases, It may

safely be said that in no literature can there be found a greater
perfection of style. It is his enduring glory that though he
