4. arcem omnium gentium: the sarne thought as summum
auxilium omnium gentium, p. 1 1 1, 1. 14.

9. purpuratum: among Oriental nations royal dignitaries were

that the change to the construction of indirect discourse is necessary,
since the participial construction (regnantem) cannot be continued.

was inflicted because of their failure to defend their master.

—in vestigiis: on tlte ruinS. Here Cicero takes advantage of the
hereditary dread and hatred of the Romans for the Gauls, who had
once destroyed the city of Rome.

4. Nisi vero: unless indeed, used ironically. —L. Caesar:
L. Julius Caesar StrabO, a distant relative of the greater Julius
