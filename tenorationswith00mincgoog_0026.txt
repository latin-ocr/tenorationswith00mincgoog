4 INTRODUCTION

M. Licinius Crassus, (4) The army, which since the time of
Marius was fast becoming a mercenary soldiery, was a new force
to be reckoned with. In this Cn. Pompey already reigned un-
questioned.

When Pompey returned from his victorious Spanish campaign
in 71 13.c., he became estranged from the senatorial party, which
he had previously supported. Thereupon a coalition of the
democrats and knightS, both of whom wereopposed to the
dominant party, was formed with Pompey as its leader. The
measures of the opposition were successful. Pompey secured
the triumph which the senate had jealously refused him, and
with Crassus as colleague was elected consul for the ensuing
year. The privilege of initiating legislation was restored to the
tribunes of the people. The knights were reinstated upon the
benches of the iudicia, side by side with the senators, In this
organized attack upon the Sullan constitution Cicero espoused
the cause of the knightS, and Pompey became henceforth his
political chief.

The fortunate circumstance of Cicero’s popularity in Sicily
enabled him to strike a forceful blow for the party of opposition.
Gaius VerreS, governor of Sicily, whose name remains to this
day a synonym for official cruelty and rapacity, had been guilty
during his administration of every crime which lust and avarice
could suggest. At the expiration of his term of office, which
had been prolonged to three yearS, he was impeached by the
Sicilians on a charge of malversation. They placed their case
in Cicero’s hands, VerreS, on account of his powerful connec-
tions in the senate, coul'd safely count upon the assistance of
the government, while his ill-gotten gains gave him unlimited
means for bribery. “The first year in my province,'’ he
said, “gave me money enough for myself 3 the second, for
my friends 3 the third, for my judgeS.'' The great advocate
and orator Q. Hortensius Hortalus undertook his defense, and
Verres entertained little fear as to the outcome. All the usual
delays and evasionS, however, were foiled by Cicero's alertneSS.
