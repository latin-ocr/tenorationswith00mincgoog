IN CATILINAM TERTIA ⁶ 289

to ten years. Their membership in the order covered a period of at
least thirty yearS, ten to learn their dutieS, ten to perform them, and
ten to impart them to others. Their services were devoted to Vesta
and her temple. There they guarded the eternal fire, the extinction
of which foreboded disaster3 there they offered daily sacrifices to
the goddess and prayed for the safety of the commonwealth. See
the illustration, p. 116. — absolutionem: nothing is known of the
trial to which Cicero refers here.

1. Capitoli incensionem: the temple of the Capitoline Jupiter
on the Mons Capitolinus had been destroyed by incendiarism in
83 B.c. According to TacituS, the destruction of the Capitol in
69 A.D. was thought by the Gauls to forebode the end of Roman
dominion. To emphasize the continuance os empire, it was rebuilt
after-every conflagration in the same form, but each time with greater
magnificence.— Cethego: concerning his character, cf. Sall. Cat.
43, Natura ferox, vehemens, manu promptus erat,· maximum bonum
in celeritate putabat.

3. Saturnalibus: i.e. Dec. 17. The Saturnalia, festival of
Satnrn, was celebrated by the rustic population of ancient Latium
as a sort of joyous harvest-feast, and in every age was a period of
absolute relaxation and unrestrained merriment. Such a day, on
which all distinction between classes was lost sight of, the rich keep-
ing open house and the slaves mingling with their masterS‚ would
offer a iavorable opportunity for carrying out the designs of the
conspiratorS.

V. 5. ne longum sit: 'not to be tedious. Cicero is fond of such
parenthetical clauses of purpose.—tabellas, signum, linum: see
Introd., pp. 45, 46.

8. ipsius manu: the Romans often kept educated slaves who
acted as amanuenses.

14. qui . . . respondisset, dixissetque: the second of these .

clauses is explanatory of the first, although he had attempted to make
some explanation, saying.

15. tamen: i.e. despite the evidence against him. .

18. ferramentorum studiosum: i.e. he claimed to be a collec-
tor. Notice that Cethegus used a word that lacked the disagreeable
connotation of telorum.

21. in . . . sententiam: to about tlte same purport.

24. avi tui: P. Cornelius LentulUS, consul in 162 B.c. and after-
wards princeps senatus. In 121 B.C. he was wounded during the

rioting which resulted in the slaying of C. Gracchus and the triumph
of the optimates (cf. p. 117, l. 11 ff.).
