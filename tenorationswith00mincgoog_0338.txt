of Transalpino Gaul. dwelling between the Rhone and Isere and
extending as far north as the Lake of Geneva; they had been con·
quered by the Romans in 121 13.c. Their ambassadors had come
to Rome to ask of the senate relies from the oppression of Roman
officials (cf. Sall. Cat. 40).

13. tumultus Gallici: can only refer toan uprising in Cisalpine
Gaul, for the term tumultus is not used of wars carried on outside
of Italy. Cf. Cic. Plu‘l. 8. 1, Maiores nostri tumultum Italicum,
quod erat domesticus, tumultum Gallicum, quod erat Italiae fim'ti- ⁰
mus, praeterea nullum nominabant. — P. Lentulo: P. Cornelius·
Lentulus Sura, consul in 71 B.c.‚ had been expelled from the senate
in 70 B.c. because of his infamous life. In order to regain his seat
in the senate, he again became an applicant for the praetorship, and

Α was ree‘lected to that office for 63 B.C.

14. eodemque itinere: on their way home the ambassadors of

Ἰ the Allobroges were to visit Catiline in Etruria. — cum litteris man-

datisque: an inaccurate statement. From p. 100, l. 8 it is evident
that the letter for Catiline was given to Volturcius, not to the am-
bassadors: while p. 100, 1. 16 shows that the three letters written by
the conspirators were not addressed to Catiline, but to the nation of
the Allobroges.

16. Τ. Volturcium: one of Catiline's followers‚ who later on,
upon the promise of pardon, turned informer against his chief.

17. facultatem: begins the principal clause.

21. 1.. Flaccum et C. Pomptinum: L. Valerius FlaccUS‚ prae-
tor in 63 B.c. and afterwards propraetor of Asia, was accused in
59 13.c. of extortion in that province. Cicero and Hortensius de-
fended him and secured his acquittal. C. Pomptinus, one of
F laccus' colleagues in the praetorship, was governor of the prov-
ince of Gallia Narbonensis in 61 B.C., and distinguished himself by
defeating the AllobrogeS, who were then in rebellion‚ their services
to the Roman state during Cicero's consulship having brought thern
no relief. In 51 B.C. he served as Cicero's legate in Cilicia.

1. amantissimos rei publicae: most patriotica*

2. qui . . . sentirent: whose political sentiments were always
noble and excellent. Sentirent is subj. of characteristic or of cause.

3. sine recusatione: unhesitatingly.

4. cum advesperasceret: towards evening.

5. pontem Mulvium: a bridge over the Tiber and leading to
the Via Flaminia, built in 109 B.C. by the censor M. Aemilius

Scaurus. It has been suggested that the word Mulvius may be a
corruption of Aemilius.
