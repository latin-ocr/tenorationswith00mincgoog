suit had to be brought (actio iudicati). Only after the decision ]

of this second suit did the state execute the judgment.

(2) Criminal. In case of any infringement os laws or κ

edicts which might be¹ considered as menacing the welfare

of the commonwealth the state took action. The conduct of ξ

criminal cases was in three wayS. (a) The summary action
of the tresviri capitales. Ordinary criminals, slaveS, or people
of low station caught in flagranti were punished summarily.
Against men of prominence this method of procedure was not
allowable. (b) A magistrate could pronounce capital punish-
ment or a fine against a citizen. In case of capital punishment
or afin‘e of more than 3020 asses, the condemned had the right
of appeal (ius provocationis) to the comitia centuriata and
comitia tributa respectively. In these assemblies the magistrate
who had rendered judgment defended his decision. (c) Special
courts (quaestiones extraordinariae) were appointed by the
senate, generally through a decree of the people, to investigate
unusual crimeS. If found guilty, the condemned did not have
the right of provocatio, These trials had generally a political
bearing. In later times standing courts (quaestiones perpetuae)
were established, at first to investigate cases of malversation
(de repetundis). Similar courts were established, most of thern
in Sulla's time, for the trial of cases of murder (de sican‘is and
de veneficis) 3 forgery and perjury (de salsis) 3 illegal canvass
for office, as by bribery (de ambitu) 3 embezzlement (de pecu-
latu), treason (de maiestate); and assault (cle vi). These
courts were presided over by a praetor or ex—aedile. The
jurors were selected by lot from a body of three hundred
and sixty men, appointed annually by the praetor. Up to the
time of C. Gracchus only senators could serve as jurors 3 from
Gracchus to Sulla only knights3 under the Sullan constitution
again only senators 3 and after 7o B.C. the jurors were drawn
in equal numbers from among the senatorS, knights, and
tribuni aera rii.
