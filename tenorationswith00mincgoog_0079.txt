ity. Their names were given to their year of office. The
insignia of the consul were the sella curulis, the toga praetexta,
and twelve lictors.

In the early republic the magistrate afterward known as the Praetura.
consul was called praetor. 'l'he first praetor in the later mean·
ing of the term was appointed in 366 13.C. from among the
patricians. No plebeian was eligible to this magistracy until
337 13.C. The praetor was called conlega consulibus, and was
elected by the comitia centuriata. His chief sunction was
judicial administration. He possessed the imperium, and dur-
ing the absence of the consuls from the city acted as their
representative. In 243 13.C. a second praetor was added.
Thereafter the one to whom was assigned by lot the adminis-
tration of justice when both parties were citizens was known
as praetor urbanus‚· the other, to whom fell the adjudication
os questions between citizens and foreigners or between sor·
eigners, was the praetor inter peregn‘nos. With the organiza-
tion of the first provinces their number was increased to four.
In the time of Cicero there were eight, six of whom had
charge of the criininal courts (quaestiones). At the close of
their year of office they were assigned the command of a prov-
ince. Their insignia were the sella curulis, the toga praetexta,
two lictors while in the city, and six while in the provinces.

There were four aedileS. Two were chosen by the concilium Aediles.
plebis, and were ‘known as plebeian aedileS. The other two
were chosen by the comitia tributa proper, and were called
curule aediles. The duties of the two classes were essentially
the same. They had supervision of the streets and public
buildingS, and os sanitation, the fire department, and the
police (cura urbis). They had charge of the grain marketS‚
and superintended the largess to the populace (cura annonae).
They managed the public games and festivals (cura ludorum).
If the aedile by means of his private fortune furnished mag-
nificent spectacles for the people, he found the popularity thus ’
acquired of great advantage when he next sought office.
