TEN ORATIONS OF CICERO 35

faction, first carne into notice in 57 ss.c., when as tribune of the
people he made himself the champion of Cicero's recall. Open
conflict between him and Clodius ensued. Each went about
accompanied by an armed band of slaves and gladiators, Street
brawls were of frequent occurrence, and all Rome was terror-
ized by the license and violence of the two ruffianS. When
after some months Clodius was temporarily worsted and Cicero
recalled, the fury of the storrn abated, only to break out still
more fiercely four years later when Milo began his canvass for
the consulship, and Clodius for the praetorship. Bribery and
violence were resorted to by all factionS, and so far prevailed
that the electioris could be held neither in July nor at any date
during the autumn to which they were from time to time post-
poned. Cicero in Pro Sestio gives us a vivid picture of the
anarchy existing in the capital at this time. “You remember
how the Tiber was full of corpses and the public sewers choked,
and how the blood had to be swabbed up with sponges in the
Forum.'' An attack was made upon Cicero himself on the Via
Sacra, but it was repelled by his unusually strong bodyguard.
“Clodius might easily have been killed,” he writeS, “ but Ι arn
tired of surgical operations.’' The senate wished to name an
interrex, but this action was vetoed by a tribune, and Rome was
actually sor a time without any lawful executive authority.

Jan. 18, 52 13.c.‚ Milo, accompanied by his wife and a retinue
of three hundred attendants, set out in a heavy traveling car-
riage for Lanuvium, of which town he was dictator. On the
same day Clodius was returning with a guard of thirty armed
slaves from Aricia to Rome. The two parties met, probably by
chance, near Bovillae, not far from a shrine of the Bona Dea.
They had nearly passed each other when an altercation arose
between some gladiators in Milo's train and Clodius’ slaves. In
the brawl which followed Clodius was wounded. He was car-
ried into a neighboring inn, from which by Milo's orders he
was afterward dragged and slain. His body was lest lying in
the roadway until the senator Sextus Tedius chancing to pass
