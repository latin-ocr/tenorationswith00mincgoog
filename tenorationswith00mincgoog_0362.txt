3 10 NOTES

the beaks (rostra) of captured ships with which it was adorned.—
agendum: sc. cum populo. Only the higher magistrates had the
right to address a contio, or to press legislation (agere cum populo)
before the comitia or (agere cum plebe), in the ease of the tribunes,
before the concilium plebis. They might, however, grant any private
person permission to address a contio. Hence ‘Cicero speaks of the
place as most dignified (amplzksimus) for a magistrate, and most
honorable (ornatzlrsimus) for a private citizen, since only men of
prominenee (optimo cuique) were given such recognition.

17. aditu laudis: path to fame,· abl. of separation dependent
on prohibuerunt, and objective genitive. — optimo cuique ε Α. 313.
b, B. 252. 5. c; G. 318. 23 H. 515· 23 W. 433. 3.

20. ab ineunte aetate : from earliest manhood.

24. temporibus: this word and periculum (cf. l. 26) are fre·
quently used of the hazards of the courts of law. There was no
recognized legal profession among the Romans. Legal services
were gratuitous and acceptance of pay forbidden by law, though it
was customary for the defendant to show his appreciation by volun·
tary presents. Thus Verres gave Hortensius a valuable statue of the ἕ
Sphinx. Cicero himself states that he never accepted any gifts for ¹
his services. But even if no pecuniary advantage was derived, the
influenee and prominenee thus gained were a distinct advantage in
political life. Notice that Cicero uses tempus in two senses in this
sentence. The Romans did not consider this a blemish of style,
but rather affected it.

2 5. ab iis: construe with vacuus.

26. oausam: interest&

28. dilationem comitiorum: an adjournment of the comitia
could be brought about in two ways. A magistrate might announce
some unfavorable omen, such as a case of epilepsy or a stroke of
lightning3 or a tribune might interpose his veto (see Introd., p. 58).
In the excitement of party strife great abuse was made of this right
of vet0, and ill omens were observed whenever they were wanted.
Moreover, the proceedings were rendered invalid if the business
before the comitia had not been finished by sunset.

1. primus: does not modify praetor, but has the force of an
adverb modifying renuntiatus sum. Of the eight praetors to be
chosen, Cicero had been the first to be elected, and that not merely
by a maj0rity of the votes of the centuries (See Introd., p. 50) but
unanimously (centuriis cunctis). Twice, however, a Subsequent
dilatio comitiorum made his election void, and only at the third
meeting was the voting for all eight praetors completed and the
