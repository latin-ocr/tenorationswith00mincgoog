magnetism, fascinating address, and unusual intellectual ability,
but of totally depraved character. While he was probably

not so black as he has been painted, the most favorable opin- J

ion pronounces him a dissolute, rash, and unprincipled politi-
cian, who attempted to mend his ruined fortunes by bloodshed
and revolution; and who failed in this, as he had failed in
legitimate meanS, because he lacked that keen judgment of men
and conditions so essential to successful leadership.

He had long been before the public, As Sulla's zealous
partizan he had won during the time of the proscriptions an
unenviable notoriety by the atrocity of the murders which he
committed. He had held the offices of quaestor, aedile, and
praetor. In 66 B-C. he announced 'himself a candidate for the
consulship. From this canvaSS, however, he was debarred on
account of an action then pending against him for the extortions
which he had committed the previous year when propraetor of
Africa. His acquittal, secured by the expenditure of nearly all
his ill-gotten gainS, left him free to enter upon the canvass' of
the year 64 13.c. In this he was defeated, Cicero and C. Antonius
Hybrida, a man notoriously in sympathy with Catiline’s planS,
being his successful rivals. In the interval between these two
attempts to obtain the consulship he had been concerned in a
revolutionary plot, the details of which are not clearly known.
This so-called first conspiracy failed utterly.

Undaunted by these reverseS, Catiline again in 63 13.c. offered
himself for the consulship. Cicero was most active in his oppo-
sition. By securing to Antonius the proconsular administration
of the province of Macedonia he succeeded in estranging him
from Catiline's interests. Among the rn‘eans which he used to
insure Catiline's defeat, Cicero carried a stringent law against
bribery. Thereupon, fearing that he might become again dis-
qualified, Catiline resolved upon the assassination of Cicero and
many of the leading senators, The slaughter was set for the day
of the consular elections. Information of the plot, however, was
conveyed to Cicero in fullest detail by one of the many spies
