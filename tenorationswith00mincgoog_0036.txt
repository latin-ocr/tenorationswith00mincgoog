Philippica.

the deed of the conspiratorS. Under the conviction which he
had gradually formed that Caesar had ruthlessly destroyed the
constitutional liberties of Rome, he wrote to Atticus concern-
ing the assassins, “ Their names will be glorious as heroeS, nay
rather as godS.” He hastened to put himself in communica-

But the conspiratorS, frightened by the attitude of the people,
far from assuming control of the government‚ remained shut up
in the Capitol until assured of their safety by Antony. The
senate was convened, and it was decided to make no inquiry

Cicero's duel with Antony was begun by the delivery of the
first Philippic in the senate, September 2, 44 B.C. The second
of the series was never spoken, but published as a politica]

v pamphlet. It is probably the bitterest excoriation in existence.

There were fourteen of these speecheS, the last of which was
delivered April 21, 43 13.C., upon the news of the defeat of
