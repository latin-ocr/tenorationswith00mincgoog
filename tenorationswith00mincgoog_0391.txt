24. datam: see note on conditam, p. 103, l. 29.

25. iis tabulis: abl. of means.

V. 28. Appi: Appius Claudius Pulcher, the father of Cicero's
enemy Clodius. l-le was afterwards expelled from the senate, prob-
ably on the ground of his carelessness in keeping the records. We
find on this page the names of four of the praetors of 89 B.c., Q. Me-
tellus Pius (l. 6), AppiuS, Gabinius, and L. Lentulus,

29. Gabini: P. Gabinius Capito. Some years after his praetor-
ship he was convicted of extortion in his province of Achaia (dam-

30. fidem resignasset: had destroyed tlte credit. Restgnare
means to unseal, to break the seal of a document3 therefore, to
destroy all saith in its genuineness.

32. Lentulum: in whose court trials concerning the right of
citizenship were probably held. —veneritz see note on p. 109. l. 6.

1. litura: literally a smoothing over of the wax on a writing-

10. legem Papiam: see Introd.‚ p. 33.

12. illis: i.e. the records of Regium, Locri, Naples, and Taren-
