MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO

‚ils Place in History. — In the long list of illustrious citizens
frepublican Rome, the name of Marcus Tullius Cicero
Hs a place second only to that of Julius Caesar. Unaided
s the accidents of birth, wealth‚ or influence, by mere force
κ’ natural talent and unceasing industry‚ he made himself,
an age of great men, a power in the Roman state, an orator
h but one superior in history, and the greatest master of the
tin language. The most modern of the ancientS‚ he is still
fliving influence in thought and speech.

= The Story of his Life. — Cicero was born January 3, 106 13.C.,
lon his father's estate near Arpinum, a little mountain town of
¹the Volsci nossessing the full Roman franchise and noted as
¹¹the birthplace of the great Marius, His father came of an
’ old equestrian family. His mother Helvia, according to Plu-
tarch, belonged to the nobility.

, Of Cicero's childhood little is known. None of his family
¹ had ever taken any part in Roman official life, but his father, a
¹ man of cultivated tastes and means sufficient to gratify them,
seems to have been ambitious for his sons, At an early age
Marcus and his younger brother Quintus were taken to Rome
on account of the superior educational advantages to be found
there. Young Cicero was most fortunate in his advisers and
instructorS, among whom from first to last we find such noted
names as Archias,¹ the poet ; Molo of Rhodes, the rhetorician ;
the Scaevolae, jurists; Crassus and AntoniuS, the orators 3
