9. conlegae meo: C. Antonius Hybrida.—-laus: notice that
the praise was bestowed, not in recognition of anything Antonius
had done for the state, but in thankfulness that he had done noth-
ing against it. This was indeed strange praise sor a consul, but his
name could not with propriety be wholly omitted, and there was
nothing else to be said in his favor. He had been a friend of Cati-
line and was at first in sympathy with him. Cicero, however, had
induced him to desert the conspirators by promising him the gov-
ernorship of the rich province of Macedonia, which had fallen by
Iot to himself. Antonius had probably already taken the field
against Catiline.

2 5. sanari: be restored to reason.

27. supplicatio: in its primitive meaning a bending of tlte ἐπει,-
hence a day of prayer, and here a thanksgiving. In. early times such
