3 20 NOTES

ram-2 great estatoe, and there raised three legions. After gaining some
134 advantages over opposing forceS, he led his army to Sulla in Apulia.
Sulla, delighted with his energy, saluted him as imperator, thatis
a general commanding an army in his own name.
21. hoste, inimico: this is almost a locus classicus for the dis·
· tinction between these words—quisquam: what is the negative
idea that requires this pronoun?

24. alienis: this adjective is used regularly in place of the pos-
sessive genitive of alius.

2 5. suis imperiis : ‘⁴ It was customary for a Roman knight‚ when
he had served the time 'ordered by law, to lead his horse into the
Forum before the two magistrates called censors‚ and after having
given an account of the generals and other officers under whom he
had made his campaignS, and of his own actions in them, to demand
his discharge. . . . The senior censor then addressed him as
follows, ‘Pompey the Great, 1 demand of you whether you have
served all the campaigns required by law?' He answered with a
loud voice, ‘I have served them all, and all under myself as general’”
(Plut. Pomp. 22).

27. Civile: throughout the struggle, Pompey was Sulla's most
brilliant general. ,

28. Africanum: Cn. Domitius AhenobarbuS, one of the partizans
of MariuS, had escaped to Africa and formed an alliance with Hiar-
baS, the pretender to the throne of Numidia. Pompey defeated
Ahenobarbus in 81 B.c., and within forty days put an end to all
opposition in Africa. For this victory a triumph was granted him,
although he had not yet risen to senatorial rank. Up to this time
only magistrates with the imperium (dictator, consul, praetor) had
been allowed to celebrate a triumph—Transalpinam: while on
his march to Spain in 77 B.C., Pompey had to contend in several
fierce engagements with Gallie tribeS, which had probably been in-
duced by Sertorius to dispute his passage. —Hispaniense z see note
on p. 126, l. 3o.—mixtum ex . . . nationibus: in reference to
the motley character of the forces of Sertorius.

29. servile: Pompey's share in crushing this insurrection of
gladiators and slaves was very slight. Under the able leadership
of SpartacuS, a Thracian gladiator, they had defeated four Roman
armieS, when the command was assigned to the praetor M. Crassus,
who had been one of Sulla's lieutenants. At first he met with
serious reverseS, ancl requested the senate to recall M. Lucullus
from Macedonia and Pompey from Spain to assist him3 but before
any reinforcements could reach him, he met and utterly routed
