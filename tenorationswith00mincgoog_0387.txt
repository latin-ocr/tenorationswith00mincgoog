oric. but including all the studies that make for culture. In the
middle ages the artes liberales were considered to be seven in nurn-

and astronomy. Compare the mediaeval saying2—

Gram loquitur, Dia verba docet, Rhe ver⁸ba ministrat,
Mus canit, Ar numerat, Ge ponderat, As colit astra.

20. nullum . . . abhorruisse: litotes—earum rerum: i.e.
ingeni, eaercttatiom‘s, rationisque.

21. vel in primis: among tlte very first. Vel is often used to
still further strengthen a superlative—A. Licinius : for effect,
Cicero uses the poet's Roman name in his first mention of him.—

ing my lzfe from thot time on), l see tltat this man was my gm‘de in

wonderer.-- neque: and not—aut: used sor ac because of the
negative neque.

5. ne . . . fuimus: let me say tlcat I too have never been devoted
exclusively to this one pursuit, i.e. oratory. Perhaps Cicero is think-
ing of his own essays in poetical composition, for which see Introd.,
p. 20. Notice that the use of fuimus instead of sumus shows that
dediti is here used as a predicate adjective.

6. artes . . . pertinent: substantially equivalent to optimae
artes or artes liberales.

7. quoddam, quasi, quadam: used to soften the metaphorical

use of vinculum and cognatio. Trans. quasi by as· it were or so to
