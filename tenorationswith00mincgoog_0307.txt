of P. Cornelius Scipio Afrioenus Major. ,

7. Μ. Fulvius: M. Fulvius Flaccus, consul in ¹25 13.c., a friend
of the Gracchi, perished in 121 13.c. with the younger Gracchus.—
Ο. Mario, 1.. Valerio: C. Marius and L. Valerius Flaccus were the
consuls of 100 13.c.‚ the year that C. Servilius Glaucia and L. Apuleius
Saturninus were attempting to inaugurate their revolutionary legisla-
tion. To suit his own purposeS, Cicero exaggeratos the promptness
of the consuls in suppressing the demagogueS‚ who took up arms in
their own defense and seized the Capitol. Having been forced to
surrender‚ they were detained in the Curia Hostilia with the more
prominent among their followers‚ there to await their trial. Marius,
who was personally well-disposed toward both Glaucia and Saturni-
nus, acted with the greatest reluctance‚ and had it not been for
the zeal of the partizans of the senate, the prisoners might have
esoeped. As it waS, the mob unroofed the Curia and stoned them
to death.

14. interfectum esse: cf. duci, p. 69, l. 16, and the note3 this
rare use of the perf. inf. with oportun, decuit, etc. is confined almost
entirely to the passive voice. ae

17. Cupio, cupio: anaphora—patres conscripti: see Introd.‚
p. 52.—me esse: A. 563. b; B. 331. IV. a; G. 532. R. 23 H.

19. inertiae nequitiaeque: A. 3523 B.2o8. 13 G. 3783 H.456;
W. 367.—-Castra . . . conlocata ε C. ManliuS, formerly one ofSulla's
centurions‚ was among those who had espoused Catiline's cause.
Near Faesulae, a town in northern Etruria commanding a route into
Cisalpine Gaul through a pass in the ApennineS, he was collecting
an army ready to march upon Rome as soon as Catiline should give
