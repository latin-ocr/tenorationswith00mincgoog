MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO 5

When the case: was actually brought to trial, the mass of
evidence presented by Cicero was so overwhelming, the lash of
his invective so terrible, that VerreS, realizing that no jury would
dare acquit him, withdrew from the trial by the advice of Hor-
tensius and went into voluntary exile. Cicero published as a
political document the speeches against Verres, including those
which had not been delivered. The condition of affairs there
disclosed was so appalling that public opinion demanded the
restoration of the knights to the benches of the iudicia as a
check upon the evils of provincial administration. The su-
premacy of Hortensius was broken, and thenceforth Cicero
was acknowledged to be the foremost advocate of Rome.

In the course of his busy life at the bar, however, Cicero kept
his eyes fixed upon the official succession by which alone he
could reach the summit of his ambition. He was elected
curule aedile while the action against Verres was still undecided,
attaining -this office, as he did all the other magistracieS, at
the earliest age permitted by law. Three years later he served
as praetor. While holding this office he made a bid for popular
favor and the good-will of Pompey by delivering in the Forum
the oration Pro Lege Manilia ¹· in support of the law investing
Pompey with supreme command in the war with Mithridates,
This oration was his first attempt to deal with matters purely
political, and it was admirably adapted to the demands of the
occasion. At the close of his praetorship he refused the lucra-
tive command of a province in order to devote the next two
years to his canvass for the consulship.

A political canvass at that time was a very complicated mat-
ter, and Cicero made use of every advantage the system offered.
He was opposed by six candidateS, of whom L. Sergius Catilina
and C. Antonius Hybrida were very prominent and dangerously
popular. Not since the time of the great Marius had a ‘ new
man ’ been raised to the consulship. It is doubtful whether the
outcome would have been favorable to CicerO, had it not been
