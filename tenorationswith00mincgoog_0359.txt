IN CATILINAM QUARTA 307

14. Paulus : L. Aemilius PauluS, the father of the younger Scipio.
In the third Macedonian war he defeated King Perseus near Pydna
in 168 B.C.—currum: triumphal chariot. Cf. Livy, 45. 40. 6, ln
catenis ante currum victoris ducis per urbem hostium ductus.

15. gloria: abl. of quality—bis: Marius defeated the Teutones
at Aquae Sextiae in 102 B.c., and the Cimbri near Vercellae in
101 B.C.

16. anteponatur omnibus Pompeius: in making this estima-
tion of Pompey's achievementS, Cicero was doubtless influenced by
the fact that Pompey was still living. History often reverses the
judgment which a man forms concerning his contemporaries.

19. nisi forte : denies in advance the correctness of the supposi-
tion which it introduceS.

21. habeant quo: may have a place to which. Cicero says
elsewhere, Mihi quidem Cn. Pompeius multis· audientibus lzoc
tribuit, ut diceret frustra se triumphum tertium deportaturum

fuisse, nisi meo in rem publicam beneficio ubi triumpharet esset
habiturus.

22. uno loco: in one respect.

28. depravati: led astray.

30. reppulerie, possis: see note on vebs, p. 114, l. 12.

34. Id: sc. bellum.

3. coniunctionem: this harmony did not last long. Only two
years later Cicero writes, Credo te audisse nostros equites paene a
senatu esse disiunctos.

XI. 6. pro imperio . . . provincialibus: an enumeration of the
various advantages to be obtained from the administration of a
province, The governor commanded an army (eaercitu) and had
unrestricted power (imperio). If fortunate, he might have the
opportunity of conducting a successful war, in reward for which
service he would receive upon his return to Rome a triumph
(triumpho), as well as the title imperator and wreaths and other
tributes (ceterisque laudis inszgnibus). In his province he might
forrn valuable connections (clientelis, hospitiis), which later on were
likely to prove a source of social, political, or financial influence.

7. qnam neglexi: Cicero had really refused two provinceS, the
one that he might have had after his praetorship and the one
assigned to him as consul. Life at Rome had a zest for him
which no consideration of the wealth or influence to be derived
from the government of a province could tempt him to foreg0.
When, however, the province of Cilicia was forced upon him
twelve years later (see Introd., p. 11), his administration was a
