23. omnium : used for omnium rerum, and neuter, not masculine
This ambiguity is generally avoided by using only the masculine as
a substantive when the two genders have the same form.

24. tabulae: account-books. In a political sense tabulae novae
meant a cancellation of old accounts— and therefore of old debts- ¹
either in part or wholly. In ancient times legislation of this kind
was not unfrequent. By the lex Valeria of the year 86 B.c.‚ for
instance, creditors lost three-fourths of their mpital. Catiline's sup· Ἴ
porters expected a total abolition of outstanding debts as a result
of his revolutionary designs. Cf. Sall. Cat. 21, Tum Catilina
polliceri novas tabulas, proscriptionem locupletium, magistratus,
sacerdotia, rapinas, alia omnia quae bellum atque libido victorum

ert.

f25. meo beneficio . . . auctionariae: the expression refers to
the forced sales by which debtors were compelled to liquidate their
obligations. According to his own statement elsewhere, Cicero suc-
ceeded in bringing about some improvement in financial conditions

solutum est ,· fraudandi enim spe sublata solvendi necessitas con-
secuta est).
