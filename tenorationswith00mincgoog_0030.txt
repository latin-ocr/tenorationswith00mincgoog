8 INTRODUCTION

Roman citizen without trial should be outlawed. His meaning
was evident. Cicero and his friends—twenty thousand citi-
zenS, he tells us—arrayed themselves in mourning and appealed
to the compassion of the people. The majority‘of the knights
stood by him, and the senate passed a decree requiring its
members to lay aside the dress of the order, as was done in
times of public calamity. This decree, however, was annulled
by the consul, and the friendly knights were assaulted by gangs
of roughs employed by Clodius, But ,behind all these outrages
and more ominous than all was the approving silence of the
triumvirS. Caesar, it is true, had endeavored to winCicero to
his side by offering him the protection of a position on the
Campanian land commission, and again a lieutenancy in Gaul.

his correspondence of this period. He betrays not a trace of
Roman fortitude, but bewails constantly, now his cowardice in
not resisting Clodius or taking his own life, now the baseness of
Pompey, now the jealousy and ingratitude of those whom he
had thought his friends. The resources of literary pursuitS, the
love of his family, the kindness of his friends, the approval of
his conscience afford' him no consolation. Only the hope of
recall enables him to accept life on any termS. Fortunately
the reaction in his favor had set in very quickly. His return
