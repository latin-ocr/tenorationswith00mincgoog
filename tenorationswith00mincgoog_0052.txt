affairs in Asia. He invaded PontuS, but Mithridates expelled
him and made a counter invasion of Cappadocia. Sulla inter-
fered‚ and peace was restored in 81 B.C. on the same basis as
before.

The third war sprang up after an interval of seven years, in
74 13.C. It was occasioned by mutual distrust‚ the immediate
cause being the bequest of Bithynia to Rome by King Nico-
medes, the last of his dynasty. Mithridates was the aggressor.
He was defeated by LuculluS, the ablest general of the oligarchy,
at Cyzicus and Cabira, and was forced to fiee from Pontus
almost unattended. He took refuge with his son-in-law
TigraneS, king of Armenia, wh0‚ although he had at first refused
to engage in the war, became involved in it by harboring him.
With only twelve thousand soldiers, a band that Tigranes
thought “too many for an embassy and too few for an army,'’
Lucullus overthrew at Tigranocerta the immense force arrayed
against him. The two kings now decided to avoid pitched bat-
tles and to lure Lucullus into the mountains where they could
cut off his supplies. Shortly after, however, the Roman general
was compelled by his mutinous soldiers to abandon all that he
had so gallantly won. In 67 B.C. his unpopularity at Rome
among the democrats and the equestrian order resulted in his
being superseded by M’. Acilius Glabrio ; but the latter, appalled
by the difficulties of the situation, refused to undertake any
active measures in the field.

While affairs were in this condition, Pompey was in the
eastern Mediterranean, completing his brilliant conquest of the
pirates. He was now at the zenith of his glory. He was born
in the same year as Cicer0, 106 B.c. He began his military
service at seventeen under his father Cn. Pompeius Strabo 3

of Magnus from that general on account of his victories in Sicily

knight and too young to enter upon the career of office. In
