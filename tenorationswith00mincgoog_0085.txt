THE ROMAN CONSTITUTION 63

of Sicily and Sardinia at the close of the first Punic war. In
the two succeeding centuries Rome had brought under her
sway almost the entire circle of lands surrounding three sides
of the Mediterranean and a part of its southern coast. The
provinces bequeathed by the republic to the empire were:
Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica, Hispania Ulterior and Citerior,
Gallia Cisalpina and Transalpina, Illyricum, Macedonia, Asia,
Bithynia, Cilicia, Syria, Crete, Africa, and Cyrene.

With the first acquisition of territory beyond Italy a disÎ‡
tinction was made between the government of these districts
and that of Rome and the Italian communities. They were
removed from the consular jurisdiction and placed under the
absolute control of a special magistrate. To territory thus
governed the name provincia was applied, a word originally
signifying the field of jurisdiction of the magistrate.

Each province was governed in accordance with a formula
or constitution specially drawn up for it. While maintaining
a firm control over her provinceS, the Roman state avoided as
far as possible the details of administration. Hence, wherever
practicable, the freedom of the provincials in local matters
was not interfered with. Conditions were not unisorm even in
the same province. In'order that a people might not become
a unit through. an equally hated oppression, burdens were dis-
tributed unequally. Individuals and cities were singled out
sor certain exemptions and privileges. In one and the same
province might be found coloniae, whose inhabitants were full
Roman citizens 3 municipia, enjoying all the rights of citizen-
ship except the franchise3 civitates foederatae, whose indepen-
dence was guaranteed by treaty 3 cities exempt from taxation3
cities whose magistrates were eligible for citizenship.

At first the provinces were not looked upon as a source of
revenue for the state, and the tax (stzpendium) imposed upon
them was not far in excess of the expense incurred for their
maintenance. The amount of that tax, paid either in money
or in kind, was determined 'by the senate, and was collected
