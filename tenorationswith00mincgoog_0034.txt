not had for a long time.” He succeeded in joining Pompey‚
buton account of illness took no part in the battle of Pharsalus,
After the issue of that fateful struggle, Cicer0, who had never
been sanguine as to Pompey's succeSS, considered the cause
of the Pompeians wholly lost. He went at once, to Brundisium
to await Caesar’s return and to throw himself upon his mercy.
The waiting was long and anxiouS. Caesar did not return to
Italy as was expected, nor did he reply to Cicero's letter for

,half a year. When he did write, however, he showed unex-

situation,'' “ From him I see no reason to sear anything,'' are
but fair examples of the expressions with which his letters teem.

peians approached the uncrowned king of Rome, the friend
through whom Caesar delighted to extend his grace. But he
spent much of his time away from Rome and took little part
in the deliberations of the senate, now nothing more than an
advisory board to the great dictator. Three orationS, the
Caesarianae, delivered before Caesar in behalf of adversaries
of his, have been preserved to uS, Pro Marcell0,¹ Pro agario?
Pro Rege Deiotaro· Though these are marked by the most
extravagant eulogy of Caesar, yet in such words aS, “ Only by
restoring the state can you achieve immortality,'' there is a note
of patriotic suggestion which enables us to understand what
Cicero meant when he said, “In the midst of my slavery Ι
preserved my dignity.'’

Cut off almost entirely from the duties which public service
entaiIS, Cicero found his greatest source of comfort and con-
tentment in the pleasure of literary production. From Septem-
ber of 47 13.c. to the close os the year 44 13.c. was with him a
