364 NOTES

25. eastra Etrusca: there was a story that Clodius had started
to join the Catilinarians at Faesulae, but turned back. It may be.
however, that Cicero refers here to the depredations of Clodius in
Etruria3 cf. p. 173, 1. 10.

29. nisi . . . diceres: except such as one might say had been
pickea' man by man. This is a reference to the custom of selecting
a certain number of men of recognized valor for a desperate under·
taking and then allowing each of them to choose another on whom
he could absolutely rely, and so on. Cf. Caes. Bell. Gall. 1. 48,
Quos ex omni copia singuli singulos suae salutis causa delegerant. —
diceres: see note on velie, p. 114, l. 12.

4. quanto 1111 odio esset: how bitterly he was hated by him.
See note on p. 149, l. 1.

5. maximis . . . addictam: had been put up sor sale as a good ¹

investment and almost knocked down. By maximis praemiis are
meant the rewards that the death of Milo would bring to Clodius.
The construction is probably ablative of price.

8. Martemque communem: and tlte impartiality of Mars.

Cf. Homer, Iliad, 18. 309, “ The war-god is alike to all and a slayer
of him that would slay ”3 and Ecclesiastes 9. 11, ‘⁴ The race is not
to the swift, nor the battle to the strong.”

9. spoliantem iam z tlte man already stripping Jzis enemy of his
arms. —peroulit ab abieoto: struck him down by the hand of his
prostrate foe.

15. manu misit: immediately after the murder Milo freed the
slaves who had been with him at the time. Only slaves could be
put to the torture, and the prosecution charged that Milo had taken
this means of insuring that his slaves should not give evidence
against him.

18. Quid quaeris : what is it that you wislt to find out.

19. Nihil ad tortorem : the torturer has nothing to do with that.

xxn. 23. our . . . praemiis: why lte did not reward them
more generously.

24. neseis . . . reprehendere: you don't know how to cranam
an enemy's action.

30. Etsi: see note on p. 167, 1. 19. —idz i.e. the mere fact that ᾗ

he escaped death. —non tanti: equivalent to minoris, and so sol·
lowed by quam. For the case of tanti, see note on p. 80, 1. 1.

3. esse praemium persolutum z notice that this construction is
equivalent to the preceding quod satiavit.

5. urgent: compromise. — nuno: bnt recently. The meaning is
that the examination had not been held until long after the murder.
