October zoth in open senate, and succeeded in postponing
until the 28th the election, which for various reasons had been
repeatedly deferred. The next day (October 21) he obtained
from the senate the extraordinary decree, Videant consules ne
quid res publica detrimenti capiat. Thus virtually armed with
dictatorial power Cicero held the election under the pressure of
military force. The success of Catiline's competitors was a
foregone conclusion.

Rendered desperate by his defeat, Catiline now determined
to put in motion his schemes for the utter overthrow of the
existing rigime. His plans included assassination of his op-
ponentS, confiscation of property, and abolition of debts (novae
tabulae). His plots for a general insurrection in the disaffected
districts of Italy had been previously arranged. A considerable
force had been organized at Faesulae in Etruria and placed in
command of Gaius Manlius, one.of Sulla’s former captainS.
Armed bands were gathering in Apulia and Picenum. An
uprising of slaves and gladiators seemed imminent. The time
appeared to be especially propitious for the conspirators’ designS,
since the absence of Pompey and his legions in the east left no
large forces available at Rome. The date of October 27 had
been set for a general uprising.

Before this time, however, active counter-measures had been
taken. Two proconsuls who were waiting for a triumph and
had therefore not laid aside their imperium, were despatched,
one to Apulia and the other to Faesulae. New forces were
levied‚ and Rome was put in 3 state of siege. An attack upon
Praeneste, a strongly fortified city of Latium, was foiled. But
Catiline remained at Rome, and a widespread feeling of in-

senate to proceed against him. Fearing that the vigilance of
Cicero might prove fatal to his planS‚ Catiline decided to bring
matters to a crisis. On the night of November 6th he called a
meeting of the conspirators to arrange the last details before his
