IN CATILINAM PRIMA 271

14. quaestiones: the permanent courts. See Introd., p. 60.

16. nunc vero: translate after this non estferendum, l. 19.

17. quicquid increpuerit: at every sound. For the mood, see
A. 5933 B. 324. 23 G. 663. 13 H. 6523 W. 620.

1. mihi: A. 3813 B. 188. 2. d3 G. 347. 53 H. 4273 W. 337.

vm. 3. loquatur: A. 516. 2. b3 B. 3033 G. 596. 13 H. 5763
W. 555. The condition is assumed as possible because of the per-
sonifioetion of patria.

4. Quid, quod: see note on p. 76, l. 23.

5. in custodiam: i.e. detention in the house of some responsible
person or surveillance by him. This so—called custodia libera must
be distinguished from imprisonment in the carcer. When it became
known that Manlius was gathering a force in Etruria, L. Aemilius
Paulus accused Catiline of treason. Catiline at once offered himself
to several well-known men for this custodia libera.

6. ad: equivalent to apud, which is usually employed in this
sense.

10. Q. Metellum: Q. Metellus Celer.

12. virum optimum: ironioel, as is also the following relative
clause.

2. quam longe videtur abesse debere: how far does it seem

Ite ought to be. Notice, however, that the implied antecedent of qui
is the subject of videtur.

3. Quae . . . sint: see note on p. 73, 1. 10.

4. emori.- a suggestion of suicide, which the Romans often pre-
ferred to exile (civil death).

7. Refer ad senatum: Cicero was unwilling to accept this chal-
lenge of Catiline, for both he and his adversary knew that the senate
had no legal right to compel a citizen to go into exile, and that Cati·
line's promise to follow the senate's advice in the matter had no
significance. It is likely· that Catiline hoped to find support in the
senate, either on the part of those who favored his plans or from
those who were afraid to oppose him openly3 and if mistaken in
this, he would still have the legal right to do as he pleased. Cicero,
however, was too astute a politician to give Catiline so excellent a
chance to show the weakness of‘the conservative party, which was
certainly at this time most reluctant to engage in open conflict with
the conspirator.

9. id quod . . . moribus: for such action would not be in keep·
