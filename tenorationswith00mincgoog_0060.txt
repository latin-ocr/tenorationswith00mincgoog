aged by the popul'ar enthusiasm for Antony that he made a
hals-hearted attempt to leave Italy for Greece. Hearing, how-
ever, that Antony’s power was beginning to decline and that he

his voyage and return to Rome. He reached the city on
the last day of August and was given a most enthusiastic wel-

senate, but in November published in pamphlet form the
memorable second oration, in which in language always defiant
and often unspeakably coarse he arraigned Antony’s public life
as traitorous and his private life as infamouS. These two ora-

of Cisalpine Gaul for 43 Rc. by virtue of the appointment made
by Caesar and ratified by the senate after Caesar's death; but
Antony demanded that the governorship be transferred to him,
