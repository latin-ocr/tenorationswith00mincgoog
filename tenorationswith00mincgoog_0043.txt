Regarding him as orator, philosopher, essayist‚ and letter
writer, we may say with Forsyth: “To appreciate his full
worth, letus consider what a blank there would have been in
the annals of Rome and the history of the world, if Cicero had
never lived. He illumines the darkness of the past with the

its rays over the waste of waters. And the more we think of
all we owe him—of all he did, and wrote, and spoke—the

ment of the historiari: Vivit, vivetque per omnem saeculorum
memoriam ,· . . . citiusque e mundo genus hominum quam
Ciceronis glon'a e memoria hominum umquam cedet.”

during the bloody usurpations of the civil war.

These disintegrating elements uniting in the radical wing of
the popular party found their natural chief in Lucius Sergius
Catilina, a high-born patrician of great persona] courage and
