308 NOTES

PAGE remarkably able one. He could justly claim that in relinquishing
122 the province mentioned here he was actuated by patriotic motiveS.
The senate had assigned (see Introd., p. 64) the provinces os Mace-
donia and Cisalpine Gaul to the consuls; Macedonia, the richer of
the two, fell by lot to Cicero. He exchanged with his colleague,
however, in order to win him over from Catiline. Later he gave up
Cisalpine Gaul also, and it was assigned to Q. Metellus Celer, who
as praetor had rendered good service in putting down the conspiracy.
9. urbanis opibus: for instance, in the conduct of the case
against Verres (see Introd., pp. 3, 4).
11. studiis: plural because his devotion had been manifested in
various ways.
14. dum erit: A. 5553 B. 293. 113 G. 5693 H. 603. 13 W. 533.
123 2. eius: construe with filium, l. 3.

3. suo solius: A. 302. e; B. 243. 3. a3 G. 321. R. ²3 H.393.6;
wall-dle aris . . . sedibus: a stock phrase of Roman oratory.

Cf. Cic. Nat. Βίαν. 3. 40. 94, Est enim milti tecum pro aris ac focis
certamen, et pro deorum templis ac delubris proque urbis martir. It
is said that during the time of the Gracchi socialistic orators ·re-
counted with great pathos the fact that Roman generals always
exhorted their soldiers to fight pro aris et focis, though they could
not call one inch of Roman soil their own, and though on their
victorious return only the debtors' fate awaited those who had
fought for their native land.

9. instituistis: i.e. before Cicero interrupted the debate to de·
liver this speech (see Introd., p. 27).

10. quoad vivet: see note on p. 122, 1. 14.

See Introd., pp. 27, 28 sor the fate of the conspirators.
