1. 1. dicere incipientem timere : sor one to feel sear who is i
essaying to speak. Dicere is the object of incipientem, incipientem
the subject of timere, and incipientem timere the subject of turpe sil.
For the nervousness of Cicero and the bravery of Milo, cf. Plut. Cic. 1
35: ‘⁶ On quitting his litter to commence the cause of Milo, at the “
sight of Pompey posted, as it were, and encamped with his troops
above, and seeing arms shining round about the Forum, he was so
confounded that he could hardly begin his speech for the trembling
of his body and hesitance of his tongue3 whereas Milo meantime
was bold and intrepid in his demeanor, disdaining either to let his
hair grow or to put on the mourning habit. And this, indeed.
seems to have been one principal cause of his condemnation. Cicem,
however, was thought not so much to have shown timidity for him-
self as anxiety about his friend.''

5. novi iudici: see Introd.‚ p. 36.—inciderunt‚ requirunt:
