9. conlegae meo: C. Antonius Hybrida—laus: notice that
he praise was bestowed, not in recognition of anything Antonius
lad done for the state, but in thankfulness that he had done noth-
.ng against it. This was indeed s'trange praise for a consul, but his
name could not with propriety be wholly omitted, and there was
nothing else to be said in his favor. He had been a friend of Cati-
¹jne and was at first in sympathy with him. Cicer0‚ however, had
induced him to desert the conspirators by promising him the gov-
emorship of the rich province of Macedonia, which had fallen by
lot to himself. Antonius had probably already taken the field
against Catiline.
