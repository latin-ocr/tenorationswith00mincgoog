IN CATILINAM TERTIA 2 87

8. multos fortis: et is omitted because fortis joins with viros to
denote a single conception. ——praefectura Reatina: Reate was an
ancient town ot' the Sabines in central Italy. That Cice'ro selected
his men from among the citizens of Reate is explained by the fact
that he was the patron of their town and could trust their loyalty. A
praefectura was an Italian town or community originally governed

by a Roman official (praefectus iuri dicundo). After all Italians
had obtained the full Roman citizenship, the term praefectura, as

well as the names municipium and colonia, continued to exist only
as a historical reminiscence. ·
10. tertia fere vigilia: i.e. about three o'clock in the morning.
14. nota solie: Sallust (Cat. 45) states that the AllobrogeS, cito
cognito consilio, at once surrendered3 and (Cat. 41 and 44) that
they were acting under Cicero's instructions and aiding him to
obtain evidence against the conspirators. They may not have been

fully cognizant of his planS, and perhaps their forcible arrest may
have been intended to cover their treachery to the conspiratorS.

111. 16. sedatur: historical present. So also traduntur and
deducuntur below.

17. integris signis: see Introd., p. 45.

19. Cimbrum Gabinium: Sallust (Cat. 17) gives his name as
P. Gabinius Capito. Cicero appears to regard Gabinius as the
author of the plan to tamper with the Allobroges (horum . . .

machinatorem). Notice that when the praenomen is omitted, the
cognomen may precede the nomen.

20. suspicantem: modifies Gabinium.

21. Ι.. Statilius: a Roman knight.—c. Cethegus: C. Cor-
nelius Cethegus, a senator.

22. in litteris dandis: wrin'ng letters, The sarcasm of this
remark is fully appreciated when we notice the length of the letter
quoted on p. 102, l. 11 ff.

23. vigilaret: the ironical use of eredo is parenthetical, and so
does not affect the mood.

23· prius quam deferri: we should expect deferrentur, but
deferri is used to continue the construction of aperiri.

27. negavi . . . ut non deferrem: afuller and stronger expres—
sion for dixi me esse delaturum. Trans. l said that I would not act
in suclz a way that in a matter involving danger lo the state I could
not lay tlze facts unprejudiced before tlte council of state.

29. si: equivalent to ettam si, as often when the main clause is
negative.

31. nimiam diligentiam: tlte reproaclt of being over careful.
