THE ROMAN CONSTITUTION 5' 3

of troops and their assignment to their respective commanderS,
received the reports of generaIS, and granted triumphs and the
right to the title of imperator. (5) Provinces. Provincial gov-
ernments were wholly under the jurisdiction of the senate.
(6) Legrivlatz've. The senate discussed and formulated laws to
be presented to the assemblies. Its decrees were not binding
without the consent of the comitia, but this was seldom re-
fused. (7) Extraordinary conditions. During an interregnum
the senate appointed the interrex. In times of extreme dan-
ger the senate instructed the consuls to name a dictator with
unlimited power. After that office fell into disuse, the senate
claimed the right to pass the ultimate decree, Videant consules
ne quid res publica detrimenti capiat, which practically sus·
pended the operation of the laWS.

A session of the senate could be held only in the senate
house (Curia Hostilia) or in a temple. It was convened by
a consul, praetor, or tribune. It was the only legislative body
in the state in which (lebate was allowed. ‘

Aster speaking himself, if he so desired‚ the presiding officer
called upon the senators for the expression of their opinion
in the order of their relative importance, ex-consuls (con-
sulares) first, then ex-praetorS, and so on. Magistrates elect,
however, took precedence in their respective classeS. The
first senator of all to be asked his opinion (princeps senatus)
was a man chosen as most worthy of the honor. After the
discussion, the question was put to a vote by the president.
The vote was given by division, the senators passing either to
the right or to the left: qui lzoc censetis, illuc transite‚· qui
alia omnia, in hanc partem. After adjournment (misso or
dimisso senatu), the decree was formulated (perscribere) by
the magistrates and senators interested. It was called a
senatus consultam: if vetoed by a tribune, and therefore not
binding, senatus auctoritas. The senatus consulta were kept
under charge of the quaestors in the state treasury (Aerarium)
in the temple of Saturn.
