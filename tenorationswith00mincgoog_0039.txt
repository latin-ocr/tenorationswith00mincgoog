MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO 1 7

please all factions; and partly from a lack of earnest convic-
tion, which may have resulted from the advocate's lifelong
habit of sacrificing principle to expediency. Itis only by
remembering this weakness that we can realize the intensity of
patriotism which kept him unswervingly true to his ideal of a
free republic and gave him contage for his last grand struggle
in its behalf. In his blind idolatry of this ideal he showed
little politica] sagacity. The irresistible logie of the events of
the last hundred years made no appeal to his understanding.
He could comprehend neither the resistless forces at work for
the destruction of the Roman republic nor the hope of renewed
national life under imperial rule.

fatal consequences which they occasioned in his public career.
In the atmosphere of home and among friends we find him
amiable‚ considerate, indulgent, loving‚ and lovable. His fidelity
to his prudent friend Atticus, his affection for his loyal freed-
man Tiro, his unfailing courtesy toward his wife Terentia, the
love he lavished upon his daughter Tullia, his unworthy son
Marcus, and his sturdy brother Quintus, stand forth in striking
contrast to the coldness of the typical Roman of his day. Late
in life, it is true, he divorced·his faithful wife, but it aroused no
injurious comment among his contemporarieS, and even in his
private correspondence he remains chivalrously silent as to the
cause of the separation.

Though the age was notorious sor bribery and official corrup· purity ot ms
tion, there is not the slightest evidence that the large fortune ΜΘ·
of his later years was amassed by other than legitimate meanS.

In his administration of public affairs there is not even a sug-
gestion of scandal in connection with his name. In purity of
personal habits and manner of life he stands almost alone among
the men who controlled the fortunes of the last generation of

republican Rome.
