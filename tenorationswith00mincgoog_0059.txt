TEN ORATIONS OF CICERO 37

of dignity and worth. The first three days were given to the
examination of witnesseS, rather a farcical proceeding, since in
spite of Pompey and his soldiers the clamors of the mob

drowned out any testimony in favor of Milo. The last day was .

devoted to the summing up of the counsel, two hours being
given to the prosecution, three to the defense. The speech os
the prosecution was listened to in respectful silence or with evi—

dence of approval, but when Cicero arose, the demonstrations
were so violent and threatening that the orator seems to have

lost in some measure his sels—control. He did not speak long,
andvhis words were wanting in their usual vigor and feeling.
Milo was convicted by a vote of thirty-eight to thirteen, Cato
being one of the minority. He was banished for life, and chose
Massilia as his place of exile. In 48 nic. he joined Caelius in
his insurrection against Caesar, and met an inglorious death.

CicerO, ashamed of his weakness at the time of the trial, wrote
out in the form· known to us the speech which he had not had
the courage to deliver‚ and sent a copy of it to Milo. That
worthy after reading it remarked : “ How glad I am that it was
not spoken ; for in that case Ι should not have known the
delicious flavor of these Massilian mullets.’' The oration is a
brilliant and specious plea, the best example of Roman legal
oratory now extant.

nation of Julius Caesar in 44 13.C.‚ the consul Marcus Antonius
attempted to assume supreme power in Rome. He was a rnan
of unscrupulous character but commanding ability‚ a friend of
Caesar, and one of his officers. Cicero considered that the
removal of Caesar made possible the restoration of the republic
under senatorial rule, and vigorously opposed Antony from the
first. It was no easy task he had undertaken. The vacillation
and indecision of the senatorial party resulted in leaving all
authority in Antony's hands, “ The tyrant is dead‚'’ said Cicero,
“but the tyranny still lives.'’ At one time he was so discour-
