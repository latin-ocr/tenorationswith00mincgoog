smie to bring him to trial; yet the accusation might be renewed at
any time quoad vexit. On p. 179, l. 6, Cicero speaks of two prose·
cutions of Clodius by Milo.

XIV. 25· Reliquum . . . coarguant: an ironical statement of
the position of the prosecutors of Milo.

26. Nihil: sc. faciebat. Notice that the Latin idiom is nemo
umquam, nihil umquam, ete., not numquam quisquam, numquam
quicquam, ete.

27. Ego: emphatic, in my own case.

28. iudiciumne timui? Non servos: preserve the emphasis by
translating was it a legal trz'al that l seared ‚2⁹ was it not slave5‚ etc.

30. Diem . . . intenderat: Cicero enumerates here certain legal
formalities which would have been observed had he been regularly
impeached by Clodius. A day would have been set for the trial
(diem dicere), and the concilium plebis asked to impose a fine (mul-
tam inrogare) or a trial instituted before the comitia centuriata on
the capital charge of high treason (actionem perduellionis intendere).

3. Q. Hortensium: see note on p. 143, l. 13. He was probably
present, inasmuch as he was one of Milo's counsels. During the
agitation that preceded Cicero’s banishment, Hortensius joined a
delegation of knights which went before the senate to petition that
body to thwart the designs of Clodius. When they left the senate,
they were roughly handled by the mob.

9. Pompeio: cf. pa 70, 1. 27 ff. —monumentum sui nominis:
see note on p. 170, 1. 3.

10. Papiri: see note on p. 170, l. 15.—haec eadem . . . in
me: see Introd.‚ p. 35.

12. regiam: the Regia, the official residence of the pontifex
maximus, was at the eastern limit of the F orum near the temple
of Vesta. It was said to have been originally the royal palace of
Numa Pompilius. Though several times destroyed by fire, it was
always rebuilt on the same foundations.

13. Quid simile Milonis : what act of Milo is comparable with
these. Cf. p. 117, l. 9. — haec semper fuit: aimea' always at tlzis.

16. Potuitne: ne has here the force of nonne.

17. domum . . . defenderet: on Nov. 12, 57 13.c., Clodius laid
siege to Milo's house with a band armed with shields, swordS, and
lighted torches. He was beaten off, many of his ruffians were killed,
ind Clodius himself barely escaped by taking refuge in a neighboring
house. ‘

18. P. Sestio: one of the tribunes of the year 57 B.c., who made
vigorous efforts to secure Cicero's recall. Like Milo, he kept a band
