58 INTRODUCTION

Colossal sums were often spent in this way. To the plebeian
aediles appertained distinctly the keeping of the law archiveS,
the making of arrests at the order of ⁴the tribuneS, and the.
management of the Plebeian GameS. The plebeian aediles
were distinguished by no insignia. The insignia of the curule
aediles were the sella curulis and the. toga praetexta.

The quaestorS, originally two in number, were appointed at

first by the kingS, later on by the consuls 3 finally they were ’

elected by the comitia tributa. Their number was gradually

the senate, and arrest every function os the state. In addition
they convoked the concilium plebis, and there initiated legis-
