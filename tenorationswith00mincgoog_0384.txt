332 NOTES

32. se mittere: i.e. that hc was voting to send.

3. legibus solutus: having been exemptcd from tlte legal require-
ments. When Pompey entered upon his consulship in 70 B.c.‚
he had held no other magistracy; he was, moreover, only in his
thirty-sixth year. It had required a special decree of the senate
(senatus consulto) to make him eligible for the office. See
Introd., p. 54.

4. ullum alium magistratum: Cicero probably had in mind
only the curule magistracies 3 but inasmuch as two years must inter·
vene between the different steps of the cursus honorum, thirty-seven
may have been the accepted age sor holding the quaestorship. This
would give forty and sorty-three as the age of eligibility to the
praetorship and consulship respectively, and leave out of account
the aedileship, the tenure of which was not required.

fore he entered upon his consulship, namely the last day of Decem·
