3. frumentaria subsidia: granaries.

5. duabus Hispaniis: i.e. the Roman provinces Hispania
C iteriar and Hispania Ulterior.

6. confirmata: i'n agreement with Gallia, the nearer part of the

the name was used for the Peloponnesus only: later the whole of
Greece was organized as a Roman province under this name.

10. ciliciam: this country had been the stronghold of the pirates.

1 1. Omnes . . . fuerunt: all pirates, wherever they were.

passage shows clearly the real force of the so·called dative of sep-
aration.

14. deprecatoresque: lo plead for them. Words added with
-que often serve to complete the meaning of the words to which
they are added. Cf. .1. 15, where the meaning is did not de-
prive tlte Cretans of hope that tleeir surrender would be accepted, as
was shown by his making a demand upon them far hastages. The
dissension arising from this incident almost led to a conflict between
Pompey and Q. Metellus, then governor of Crete, who refused to
recognize Pompey's authority, having himself broken the back of
resistance in the island.

already explained in the passage beginning on p. 135, 1. 3. N otice the
consummate art with which Cicero has here made use of preterition.
While affecting in the first instance to take no notice of the com-
monly recognized abilities of a successful commander, he has given
at length a masterly exposition of Pompey's eminence in each par-
ticular, a skilful digression which heightens the effect of the unusual
qualities to a consideration of which he now returns.

2. Quid ceterae : what of the other virtues.

public officer. The discussion of this point begins with 1. 12, and
