50 INTRODUCTION

,2. The comitia centuriata was an assembly of the people
voting in centuries (centuriae). It was established by Servius
Tullius. As originally constituted, it was made up of 193 cen-
turieS, embracing the entire number of citizen8‚ the distinction
between its five classes and their relative importance being
determined by property qualifications. During the latter half
of the third century B.C. a political reorganization of the comitia
centuriata took place. Each one of the thirty-five tribes fur· ¹
nished ten centuri'eS, which together with eighteen centuries of
knightS, four centuries of -artisanS‚ and one century of the pro-
letarii (citizens of the lowest class) made the 373 centuries of

⁴ Cicero's time. Under the early republic its powers were very

extensive. They included the election of the chief magistrateS,
the right of declaring war, the final jurisdiction over capital
crimes (in consequence of the ias provocationem, and the right
to pass upon laws proposed by the magistrates, Since it was
organized as a military assembly, it held its meetings outside κ
the city waIIS‚ generally in the Campus MartiuS. It was pre-
sided over by a consul, praetor, or dictator. Gradually its im· ¹
*portance began to wane. After the first century of the republic ’
some of its powers were surrendered to the senate, others to the
courtS, while others still were assumed by the comitia tributa.

3. The comitia tributa was an assembly of the thirty-five
tribes (tribus). It was regularly summoned by a patrician
magistrate, and met in the Forum, the Capitol, or the Fla· ¹
minian Circus. It increased rapidly in importance‚ absorbing 1
many of the powers relinquished by the two older assemblieS. ³
After the year 286 B.C. its decrees were ,binding upon the ¹
whole people. To exercise its several powers it was convened
under two distinct names. (a) The comitia tn‘buta proper
was an assembly of all the people to elect curule aedileS,
quaestorS, and certain lesser magistrates and ministers of re:-¹
ligion. Each tribe had one vote, the city tribes voting origi-¹
nally before the rural; in Cicero's time all the tribes voted}
simultaneously‚ and the presiding magistrate decided either¹
