instead of illumin reference to the second AfricanuS‚ as the nearer
to Cicero in point of time. P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus Minor 1
was the first prominent Roman to find the sterling virtues of his l
countrymen not incompatible with a more liberal culture. He drew ¹
about him a number of Greek savantS, among them the historian ἰ
Polybius, and PanaetiuS, the philosopher. In this circle the two ¹
cultured Romans mentioned here, C. Laelius Sapiens and L. Furius
Philus, held a prominent place.

14. Μ. Catonem: M. Porcius Cato CensoriuS, whose name was

a vigorous statesmam a forceful orator, and not wholly ignorant of
Greek culture. He remained strenuously active for the public good
to the end of his long life.

15. adiuvarentur: by using the imperfect instead of the pluper·
fect, Cicero implies that literature not only was a help to the men
he has mentioned, but is a help to all men as well.

17. si non : notice that nisi would not do here, since siis equiva-
lent to etiam si. — tantus fructus ε it is characteristic of the prac-
ticality of the Roman mind that Cicero in his defense of the higher
learning devotes himself chiefly to the consideration of its utility-
To the Greek, the pursuit of the humanities was in itself a higher
mode of existence needing no excuse3 while the Roman viewed all
knowledge in relation to its adaptability to the needs of every-daylife.

19. iudicaretis ε you ought to consider.
