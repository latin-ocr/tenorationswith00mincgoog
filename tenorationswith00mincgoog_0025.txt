MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO 3

and Asia Minor. From his stay in Athens dates his intimacy
with his lifelong friend Titus Pomponius AtticuS. He visited
the most prominent philosophers and rhetoricianS‚ and placed
himself under the instruction of some of them, among others
his old teacher Apollonius Molo, then living at Rhodes, Of
the result of this two years' absence he wrote: “I returned
home not only a more practised rhetorician, but almost a
changed man. The overstraining of my voice had abated, my
style had lost its frothineSS‚ my lungs had grown stronger, and
my bodily frame was moderately filled out.'' Sulla was now
dead, and Cicero resumed the practice of law. In the same
year he married, his wife Terentia being presumably of a noble

At the earliest legal age, thirty-one years, Cicero became
quaestor. The duties of his office called him to the administra-
tion of the western portion of the province of Sicily, where he
displayed such ability, honesty, and disinterestedness that he

There were at this time four active influences in the Roman
state. (1) The oligarchy (optimates), or senatorial party,
was the supreme political power under the Sullan constitu-
tion. It was composed of the hereditary nobility‚ the office-
holding claSS, and was rarely invaded by a homo novus.
(2) The democrats (populares), the remnant of the Marian
party, embraced the masses of the people. In its ranks the
power of Julius Caesar was beginning to be felt. (3) The
knights (equites), the commercial and moneyed elaSS, eon-
trolled the extensive business interests of Italy and the prov-
inces, This was an order, not a political party, although it
had great political influence. Its leader was the rich noble,
