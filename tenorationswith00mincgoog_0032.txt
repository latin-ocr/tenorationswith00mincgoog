see them in the senate house without pain, or associate with
them without disgrace.'’

Caesar meanwhile never faltered in his determination to
make the orator his friend. He *treated him always with the
most unfailing courtesy and delicate consideration. Cicero
could not prefer a request which Caesar did not immediately
grant. He was lavish in his favors to Quintus Cicer0, to whom
at his brother's petition he had given a command in Gaul, and

'by the Parthians after the battle of Carrhae, a vacancy was left

in the college of augurS. This Cicero was chosen to fill. It
was a position of great dignity, “the only bribe in the posses-
