TEN ORATIONS OF CICERO 33

able. He attached-himself particularly to the Luculli, assuming
their family name Licinius with the praenomen AuluS.

Under the patronage of Marcus Lucullus he visited Sicily,
and later accompanied Lucius Lucullus upon his Asiatic cam·
paignS. The poem in which he celebrated the victories of
the latter brought him into the unfavorable notice of the friends
of Pompey‚ between whom and Lucullus there existed a spirited
rivalry. Itis more than probable that this was the motive for
the suit which was instituted against him in 62 13.c. by a certain 'the suit.
Grattius, known only from his connection with this case. The
lex Papia passed in 65 B.C. had enacted that all foreigners
(peregrini) be expelled from Rome, and Grattius charged
Archias with usurping the privileges of citizenship.

The case was tried before the praetor Quintus Cicer0, the cicero‘s
orator’s brother. Grattius seems to have failed signally in both ”⁶⁸⁰²
proof and argument. Cicero was easily able to establish the
fact that the citizenship which Archias had exercised for twenty-
seven years had been legally acquired under the provisions of
the lex Plautia Papiria of 89 B.C.‚ which gave Roman citizen-
ship to all citizens of Italian towns allied with Rome (civitates
foederatae), provided they had their home in Italy and should
enroll themselves within sixty days with one of the Roman
praetors. Then dismissing the legal questions as of no impor-
tance, he devoted himself to the more congenial task of dilating
upon the value of poetry and letters to individual and national
life. It is one of the most popular of all of Cicero’s orationS.
“Cicero speaks in ArchiaS‚’' says Lawton, “to any appreciative
student of Western Europe, as it were in a mother tongue.’'

Archias was doubtless acquitted, and Cicero mentions him as
late as 44 13.c. Judging from the few fragments that remain,
his poetic talent was greatly overestimated by his contemporaries
It has been remarked that though Cicero thought to gain
immortality from Archias' poem on his consulship, by the irony

of fate it is Cicero’s oration that has kept the name of Archias
from oblivion.
