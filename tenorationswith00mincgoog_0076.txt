IV. The magistrates—It had become customary during
the last two centuries of the republic for young Romans of
illustrious familieS, before entering upon a public career, to gain
some experience of military life and render some service to
the state by joining the army as companions (contubernales)
of some general, or as officers under him. Such service was
voluntary, however, and not a necessary condition of entrance
upon a public career.

Custom at Rome had always favored a certain order in
holding the various public offices (gradus or cursus* honorum).
The lex Villia annalis of the year 180 B.c. determined that
only one who had held the quaestorship could become a can-
didate for the praetorship, and only an ex-praetor could be-
come consul. Moreover two years must intervene between
these offices. The office of aedile was generally held by an
ex-quaestor before he became a candidate sor the praetorship3
but the tenure of this office was not obligatory. The earliest
age of eligibility to these offices was: quaestor, thirty—ones,
aedile, thirty-seven 3 praetor, forty3 consul, forty-three.

The Roman magistrates may be classified as (Ι) ordinary,
chosen at fixed times for a fixed term: consul, praetor, aedile,
quaestor, tribune, and censor, (2) extraordinary, chosen as the
name indicates at critical times: dictator, magister equitum,
interrex. By another classification the dictator, consul, prae·
tor, curule aedile, and censor were known as curule magistrates· ζ

They were those officials who sat while transacting public busi- ἱ

ness in the ivory chair (sella curulis) 3 other magistrates used ¹
the simple sella ,· the plebeian aediles and the tribunes of the

people the subsellium, a low wooden bench, which, in contrast ἰ
to the sella curulis and the sella, offered a seat to the whole 1

college of officials,

Some characteristics were common to all the magistrates. ἔ
