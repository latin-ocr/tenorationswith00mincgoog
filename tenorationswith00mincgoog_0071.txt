THE ROMAN CONSTlTUTION 49

Since a certain sum of money was given them for the purchase
and keeping of a horse, they were called equites equo publico,
For military purposes there were added later equites equo
private, wealthy citizens not nobles who served in the cavalry
at their own expense. From the time of the Gracchi the name
equites was applied to all who possessed the original equestrian
census, and it now had no reference to military service. The
badge of the order was the tunic with narrow purple stripe
(angustus clavus).

Under the term of plebs or populus was included the great
mass' of voters whose census was below that of the equestrian
rank. Strictly they did not form an order. They had no
special privilegeS, no insignia. In the time of Cicero they
were scarcely more than a wretched rabble‚ living largely upon
public bounty. Within their ranks a distinction was made
between the free-born (ingenui) and the freedmen (libertini).
Slaves did not obtain by manumission the full rights of citizens;
according to some authorities three generations of freedom
were required to remove the taint of slavery.

The government of the Roman state was administered by the
assemblies, the senate, and the magistrateS.

II. The Assemblies. —The people exercised their authority
through the medium of three constitutional assemblieS. They
were historically developed as follows ε -

1. The comitia curiata, the most ancient of the assemblies‚
dates from the earliest regal period. It was an assembly of
patricians in their thirty curiae or wardS‚ ten from each of the
original tribes of RamneS‚ Tities, and Luceres. It was at
first the supreme authority in the state, but its influence declined
as the patricians gradually lost their preponderance of power.
In Cicero’s time its functions were purely formal, such as
bestowing the imperium upon the consul, and receiving non-
patricians into the patrician order. These duties were dis-

charged through a representation of thirty lictores curiati.
