PRO ARCHIA POETA 34 1

tempore : for pericula, hour of need (cf. p. 123, 124, and the note).
lt refers to criminal suits, commodo to civil 511115.

8. quantum: limited by the part. gen. temporum,·l. 10. — cete-

ris : dependent on conceditur.
9. festos dies ludorum: on certain holidays games and plays

were given in honor of the gods. These public spectacles were ⁸

superintended by the aedileS‚ who, in order to pave their way to
higher officeS, often lavished the most extravagant sums on them.

10. temporum: we say time, but the Latin uses the plural be·-
cause each of the employments mentioned is allotted its own por·
tion of time. -

11. alii: notice why Cicero substitutes this word for ceteris. —
tempestivis conviviis: early banquets, 1.0. beginning before the
usual hour for dinner, about three 0 ''clock 1n the asternoon. Early
dining was an indication of idle and luxurious living.

12. alveolo, pilae: the former was disreputable and forbidden
by law (cf. aleatores, p. 93, l. 31); but the latter was perfectly
respectable and a favorite form of exercise‚ and Cicero probably
mentions it here only as frivolouS. In the game of ball most popu-
lar among the Romans the ball was thrown and caught or struck

with the hand, · it therefore did not resemble our base-hall or foot-
0311, 0111 was rather such a game as fives.

14. oratio et facultas: by hendiadys for dicende facultas.
This accounts for the singular verb crescit.

15. quantacumque. here equivalent to the more modest quan-
tulacumque.
18. multisque litteris : ana' through much reading.

20. in ea autem persequenda: and that in the pursuit os these.
The singular 03 15 due to the fact that the two abstract nouns laudem
and honestatem together convey a single idea.

21. cruciatus . . . exsili: a climax. Exile was to the Roman
the saddest of fates.

22. parvi: A. 4173 B. 203. 33 G. 379, 380. 13 H. 448. ¹3 W.
61, 62. ,

3 23.3 cottidianos impetus: a reference to the feeling which the
summary execution of the Catilinarian conspirators had caused.
The leaders of the populares had already begun to attack Cicero for
his part in this action. -

27. imagines expressas· . lfelike portraits. Exprzwmere 15 often
used of the sculptor' 5 311, and the language here is metaphorical.

30. animum, mentem: what is the distinction in meaning be-
tween these two' words ?
