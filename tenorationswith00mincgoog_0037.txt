MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO 15

Antony at Forum Gallorum.¹ It was the final effort of Rome’s

greatest orator for the commonwealth which he had tried to
save.

The consular forces were successful in a second engagement,
but Pansa had been mortale wounded in the first battle, and
in the second Hirtius was killed. Octavianus, now left in sole

command of the large forceS, became in his turn an objectos

suspicion to the senate. It was manifestly to his interest to
make common cause with Antony. He accordingly deserted
the senatorial party, and wjth Lepidus and Antony formed
the second triumvirate. A merciless proscription followed.
Among the first victims demanded by Antony was Cicero, and
OctavianuS, the slender lad to whom from the first the old
orator had opened his heart, whose cause he had pleaded in the
senate, and for the integrity of whose purposes he had stood

Cicero and his brother QuintuS, who was also proscribed‚
received the news at Tusculum and at once set out for Mace·
donia. But the necessary means for the journey were lacking,
and Quintus was forced to return to Rome to procure them.
There he and his son Quintus were taken by the assassins and
met death bravely together. Cicero proceeded to the coast.
He might have made good his escape, but his usual irresolu-

mind, he refused to continue his ssight. “Let me die,'' he
said, “in the country Ι have so often saved.'’ He was over-
taken by Antony's cutthroats on the sea-shore near his villa
, at Formiae. Forbidding his slaves to sacrifice their lives use-
lessly in his defense, he ordered them to set down the litter, and
with a steadfast composure worthy of the great career just closing
he offered his neck to the knife of the assassins, “Of all the
ills of life,'' writes Livy, “ Cicero bore none with the spirit becom-
ing a man save death itself.'’ By Antony's orders the head and
hands were severed from the body, and taken to Rome and nailed
