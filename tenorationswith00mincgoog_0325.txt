IN CATILINAM SECUNDA 283

XI. 11. cohortem praetoriam: since the time of the younger
Scipio, a body-guard attending the general. It was composed partly
of veterans who voluntarily offered their services for that purpose
(evocati), partly of young nobles, who in this way gained experience
in the art of war.

15. eiectam: stranded.

16. robur: by metonymy the word oak is used for its most prom-
inent quality, strength.

17. coloniarum ac municipiorum: may be either appositional
gen. or gen. of possession. Render urbes by strongleolds, or the
entire phrase strongly fortfied colonies and municipalitt‘es. —·
respondebunt: will be a match for.

20. quibus: construe as abl. of means with suppeditantur,
and supply as abl. of separation with eget.

21. senatu . . . nationibus: explanatory of his rebus.—urbe:
tlte city, i.e. Rome, a very common use of the word.
24. quam . . . iaceant: how powerless they are.

28. aequitas . . . prudentia: Plato's so-called four cardinal
virtueS‚ δικαιοσύνη, σωφροσύνη, ἀνδρεία, σοφία.

32. omnium rerum desperatione: utter despair.

1. ab virtutibus: the preposition is used on account of the per-
sonification of virtus.

XII. 4. antea dixi: Cicero's memory seems to be at fault, for
the speech as it has corne down to us contains nothing to which this
can well refer. —0ustodiis vigiliisque: guards by day and by
night.

8. quam: attracted, as the relative regularly is, from the number
and gender of the antecedent Gladiatores to the number and gender
of the predicate noun manum—sibi manum certissimam: a
force upon which lte could confidently rely.

10. patriciorum: besides Catiline himself, Lentulus and Cethe-
gus also were of patrician rank. — potestate . . . continebuntur:
cfss Sall. Cat. 30, Itemque decrevere uti gladiatoriae familiae Capuam
et in cetera municipia distribuerentur pro cuiusque opibuS.

11. hoo: i.e. the opening of hostilities.

15. quem . . . videtis: the heralds (praecones) could be seen
summoning the senatorS, and perhaps also the senators assembling
for the session.

16. atque adeo: used in a corrective sense, or rather. Compare
the use of the same phrase found on p. 70, l. 22.

20. erumperet: might come to lzgrht, but the words used seem to
Signify metaphorically a rushing out from a place of hiding. — Quod
