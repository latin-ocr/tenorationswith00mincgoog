16. persequendi: sc. belli.

17. gloria, salue, vectigalia: a point of honor, a question of
loyalty, a consideration of material interest.

20. certissima, maxima: on account of the fertility and pros·
perity of that province. It waS‚ however, fast being drained dry,
and this fact accounts for the support it gave to Mithridates

the construction, see note on conlocandum, p. 106, l. 5.
