PRo ARCHIA POETA 343

20. omnium ε modifies temporum and locorum as well as aetatum.
22‘. adversis: sc. rebus.

VIII. 27. videremus: subj. by attraction.

28. Rosci: the most famous comic actor of Cicero's time,
admired especially for his gracefulness. The respect with which he
is mentioned is the greater tribute in that the stage was not con—
sidered a reputable calling.

6. revocatum: recalled by applause‚ encored.

7. accurate cogitateque scripsisset: contrasted with dicere ex
tempore.

10. sic: explained by ceterarum . . . inflare.

14. Ennius: Q. EnniuS, ‘the father of Roman poetry‚' was born
at Rudiae in Calabria, in 239 B.C. Cato the Censor met him in Sar-
dinia, where he had served in the Roman army during the second
Punic war, and induced him to settle in Rome. There he lived
thenceforth, honored and esteemed by the most prominent Romans
of his time, notably the elder Africanus. Late in life he was granted
Roman citizenship, then very difficult of acquisition. His fame
rested principally upon his Annales, an epic poem on the history of

Rome, the first Latin hexameter verse. Only fragments of his poems
surv1ve. ’

15. esse videantur: Cicero was fond of closing his periods with ’

these wordS, and the ancients ridiculed their constant repetition.

17. poetae: see note on comitum, p. 74, l. 22.

18. Saxa . . . consistunt: a reference to the power of music
as told in various mythS, especially those of Orpheus, Amphion, and
Arion. -

20. Homerum: notice its emphatic position. — Colophonii . . .
permulti alii: many cities claimed the honor of having been the
birthplace of the great poet. Compare the ancient epigram ε -

Ἑπτὰ πόλεις διερίζουσιν περὶ ῥίζαν οΟμήρου,
Σμῦρνα, Ῥόδος, Κολοφών, Σαλαμίς, Χίος, Ἄργος, Ἀθῆναι.

IX. 25. alienum: one only, if any, of the cities that claimed him
was really entitled to‘ call Homer its son3 and Cicero indicates by
the use of alienum that he cannot decide between thern.

29. et: Cicero must have had it in mind to write et Mithridati-
cum bellum (cf. p. 159, l. 6); but there is an anacoluthon, due to
the digression Neque . . . celebrari.—Cimbricas res: apparently
Archias had written a poem celebrating the victory over the Cimbri
and TeutoneS.

30. 0. Mario: cf. p. 153, l. 14, where Cicero says that Marius
