2 INTRODUCTION

Roscius and AesopuS, the actors 3 and the philosophers Philo
the AcademiC, Phaedrus the Epicurean, Diodotus the Stoic.
At sixteen he received the toga virilis ‚· and at eighteen he
acquired that experience' of military affairs which was deemed
an indispensable part of Roman ⁴education, by serving during
a short campaign in the Social War under Pompeius Strab0‚
father of Pompey the Great.

He was neither old enough nor of sufficient prominence to
attract attention during the Sullan-Marian conflict, in which
public men generally paid for their opinions with liberty or life.
Thus perished the orators Sulpicius, AntoniuS, and CatuluS, while
Cotta was exiled, and Hortensius was placed for a time at least
under the ban of silence. Amidst such scenes of disorder,
Cicero pursued his studies with unflagging industry. He spent
much time in making metrical translations from the Greek and
in composing poems and orationS, sparing no effort to perfect
his style. He attended the theaters to study gesture and
expression, and haunted the law-courts in the Forum, carefully
observing legal procedure.

In 81 B.C. Sulla had succeeded in establishing the oligarchy,
and order reigned once more. During this year Cicero, now
twenty-five years of age, entered upon his career as an advo-
cate. From the first he acquitted himself with credit3 and
in the second year of his practice, the magnificent courage
and skill with which he conducted his successful defense of
Sextus Roscius—nefariously accused of parricide by Chryso-
gonuS, a creature ‘of Sulla—established his standing at the
bar, and laid the foundations for much of his subsequent
political popularity. In the following year he again defied
the dictator by defending a woman whose right to engage
in a suit before a Roman court was jeopardized by a Sullan
enactment. But soon after, either on account of failing health
or sear of Sulla, Cicero with his brother Quintus left Rome for
AthenS.

He spent two delightful years of study and travel in Greece
