TEN ORATIONS OF CICERO 31

with Sertorius in Spain. Returning from this victorious cam-
’ paign, he dispersed the temnant of the army of rebellious
slaves that had followed Spartacus, T hough still a knight, he
was granted a second triumph, and a special law was passed
enabling him to stand for the consulship. Thus in the year
70 13.c., without having held any other office and seven years
before the legal age, he became consul. At the close of his
term of office he refused a province, abandoned politic5, and
retired to private life until Rome should require his services,

His seclusion lasted two years· Under the negligent rule of
the Sullan oligarchy the corsairs who had long infested the
Mediterranean had gained great strength, even organizing states
in Cilicia and on the island of Crete. These pirates burned
Roman shipS, sacked the towns of Greece and Asia Minor, and
terrorized the Mediterranean shores, They controlled com-
merce, and even made it impossible for the corn-ships to come
to Rome. In this emergency, Aulus GabiniuS, a tribune of the
people, proposed in 67 B.c. that Pompey be invested for three
years with unlimited power over all the Mediterranean and its
,coasts for fifty miles inland. The senate resisted, but the
people passed the law. In only three months after taking
command Pompey had accomplished his task, and the Mediter-
ranean was free.

While he was still absent on this enterprise, the tribune Gaius
Manilius brought forward the bill known to history by his name.
This gave Pompey supreme command over the war with
Mithridates, Again the senate resisted, but it was evident that
the people would adopt the proposal. It was in support of this
measure that Cicero delivered in the Forum his first political
addreSS.

Cicero undoubtedly spoke in praise of Pompey in all sincer-
ity ; for the great general had as yet shown none of the griev-
ous and selfish weakness that later led him into fatal mistakes.
He was a good soldier, unacquainted with defeat, who seemed to
fight under a star of favoring destiny. He had not betrayed what
