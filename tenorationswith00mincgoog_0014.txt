viii PREFACE

Catilinarian orations, which are read first in most sch0013,
are placed first. A further reason for this arrangement
is found in the fact that the entrance requirements of
many colleges call for special care and thoroughness in
the study of the Catilinarian orations, thus rendering
it advisable that they be annotated with great fulneSS.
Following the example of a standard German edition,
the rhetorical emphasis has been indicated in the text
of the first oration by the use of italic type for words
made emphatic by position or antithesis, This feature
should prove helpful in teachi'ng students to read Latin
aloud with expressiori3 and the ability to do that is not
only valuable in itself,' but also ‘of great assistance in

the intelligent appreciation of that which is read.
The text of this edition is that of C. F. W. Mueller,

with such changes in orthography and punctuation as ,

were necessary to bring it into accord with the plan of
Macmillan's Latin Series, Lewis' Elementary Latin
Dictionary has been used as the standard for etymol-
ogy, orthography, and the quantity of voweIS‚ except
in cases where error was evident.

Sincerest thanks are due to Mr. J. C. Kirtland, Jr.,
the chief editor of this series of Latin text-book& for
most valuable suggestions given, efficient help rendered,
and unremitting efforts made to promote in every way
the success of this edition.

Acknowledgment is made to Dr. John T. Buchanan,
Principal of the De Witt Clinton High School, for
many valuable criticisms and practical suggestions.
