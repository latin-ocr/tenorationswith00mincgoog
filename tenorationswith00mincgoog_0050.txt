The fate of
Catiline.

Mithridates.

turned' toward the waiting crowds and uttered the ominous cry
‘ Vzbcerunt: Amidst the acclamations of the throngs who
escorted the consul to his home, there is said to have been
heard for the first time that title with which grateful nations
have ever since honored their greatest benefactors, ‘Pater
Patriae) , ⁷

The force of the conspiracy was broken. ’ The words ascribed
by Sallust to Cato, “ Rest assured of this, that when you pass
sentence concerning Lentulus and the rest you will decide at
the same time the fate of Catiline’s army and of the whole con-
spiracy,'’ were almost literally to be sulfilled. Nearly two-
thirds of Catiline’s army deserted when the news of the collapse
at Rome reached them. Catiline while attempting to lead the
remainder of his forces to Gaul was hemmed in between two
armies near Pistoria and compelled to give battle. Quarter
was neither asked nor given. As they' stood0in their ranks the

’ Catilinarians fell. When all was lost, their chief, “ mindful of

his race, and former dignity,’' rushed into the* midst of the
enemy and fighting bravely died a soldier's death.

V. Pro Lege Manilia Oratio. —The study of two topics is
essential to a thorough understanding of this oration, the Mithri-
datic wars and the career of Pompey previous to the year 66 13.c.

From 92 13.C. to 62 B.C. the, Roman republic had a trouble-
some ‘ eastern question ’ upon it's hands. Mithridates VI, king
of PontUS, a country lying on the southern shore of the Black
Sea, had extended his sovereignty over nearly all the lands in-
closing that se‘a. His career is one of the most romantic in
history, and many myths are mingled with the historical facts
of his biography. His aims were purely selfish, his means fre-
quently atrocious 3 but for a period of twenty—five years he was

’ the able and intelligent foe of Rome, the brain and heart of the

East in its struggle with the West. That struggle, in so far as
it was waged during his lifetime, is divided into the three wars
which bear his name.
