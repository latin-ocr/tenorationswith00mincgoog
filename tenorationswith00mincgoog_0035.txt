It was during the year 46 B.C. that the estrangement between
Cicero and his wife Terentia culminated in a divorce. Very
soon afterward Cicero married Publilia, a rich young girl who
had been his ward. In February of 45 13.C. his daughter Tullia
died. The strongest love of his heart had centered in her, and
her death left him in utter desolation. When his young wife,
who had always been jealous of Tullia, evinced a certain satis-
faction at her death, Cicero became so incensed that he
divorced her and would never see her again. His private
grief seems to have cleared his vision. His illusions in regard
to the restoration* of the republic by Caesar altogether vanished.
Henceforth the dictator's government grew so burdensome to
him that he could even approve of the dastardly murder on the
Ides of March.

The assassination of Caesar called Cicero from his books and
plunged him into the heat of a conflict which continued
throughout the remainder of his life, twenty-one months of
glorious activity, the noblest in his career. Again he saw his

every personal weakness and littleneSS. Once, it is true, early
in the struggle, he became disheartened by the incompetency
and disorder of the senatorial party, and in despair started for

winds detained him. More favorable news came, and his cour-
age revived. He returned to Rome, and from that time until
the end it was his unflinching heart and brain that held
patriotic citizens together in their hopeless struggle for the
phantom of the republic,

Though Cicero had no part in the assassination of Caesar
and no knowledge of the plot, he was heartily in sympathy with
