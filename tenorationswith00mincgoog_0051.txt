TEN ORATIONS OF CICERO 29

The first Mithridatic war was precipitated by the folly of the
Roman Manius AquilliuS, sent as a special envoy to replace
upon their thrones the kings of Bithynia and Cappadocia, who

had been expelled by the agents of Mithridates, The king of

Pontus disavowed his agents’ acts and consented to the Roman
demands. But Nicomedes III of Bithynia, one of the restored
kings, was induced by Aquillius to make an inroad upon the
possessions of Mithridates, When the latter demanded that
Nicomedes be recalled by the Romans or that he be permitted
to defend himself, Aquillius not only refused to comply with this
request, but took the field himself against him. In an incredibly
short time Mithridates had defeated the Roman armies and
overrun Asia Minor. Aquillius was captured, and the exas-
perated king quenched the thirst of the avaricious envoy by

pouring molten gold down his throat. In the height of his

success Mithridates perpetrated a crime as foolish as it was
atrociouS. He ordered the Asians to put to the sword all the
Italians within their boundarieS. No one was spared. Men,
women, and children to the number of eighty thousand, ac-
cording'to the lowest estimate, were butchered in one day.
The king continued his advance. Most of Greece and a large
part of Macedon were brought under his power, and Athens
became his European capital.

Thus affairs stood when Sulla landed in Epirus in the
summer of 87 13.c. with an inconsiderable force, no money, and
no ships, To add to his embarrassments, shortly after the
campaign began the democrats of Rome outlawed him and sent
a successor to take command of his army. Disregarding these
disturbances at Rome, Sulla prosecuted his campaign with such
success that in 83 13.c. he was able to report that he had fought
and won the great battles of Chaeronea and OrchomenuS, had
rescued Europe, had reestablished in Asia the status quo ante
bellum, and had secured a large indemnity from Mithridates.
