VII. Pro Milone Oratim—The oration for Milo is of great
historical interest on account of the insight which it gives into
the lawless conditions obtaining in the Rome of its day. To
understand the catastrophe which forms the subject of the
oration, it is necessary to review briefly a series of events
extending over the decade from 62 to 52 B.C. Neither of the
principals in the Milo-Clodian feud is deserving of any real
place in history3 neither was a good man or possessed of
unusual talent 3 both were violent and unscrupulous demagogues
of a type which flourished during this strange period of political
turbulence when the governing city of the world was itself
without a government.

Publius Clodius Pulcher belonged to that proud patrician

he had made himself the idol of the lowest classes of the
populace. His implacable enniity toward Cicero is connected
with one of his most notorious crimes. In 62 B.c.‚ disguised as

the patrician matrons of Rome were celebrating the mysteries
of the Bona Dea, a peculiarly sacred festival never before
profaned by the presence of a man. The scandal was made
the subjectos an investigation by the senate. In the trial which
followed the next year Clodius asserted that on the day when
the sacrilege was committed he had been at Interamna, fifty
miles from Rome. The alibi was disproved by Cicer0, however,
who stated that on the day in question he had seen and con-
versed with Clodius in Rome. Clodius escaped·condemnation
only by bribing his judges, and thereafter he pursued Cicero
with the most vindictive hatred. Three years later he scored
his triumph in the decree of banishment against Cicero on the
ground of the illegal execution of the Catilinarian conspiratorS.
