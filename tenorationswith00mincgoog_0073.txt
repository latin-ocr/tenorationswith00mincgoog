have its‘vote announced first (principium). (b) The con-
cilium plebis was presided over by a tribune, and patricians
were excluded from it. It chose the plebeian tribunes and

equal or higher rank than the presiding officer could adjourn
the session by announcing an unfavorable omen. All sessions
had to close at sunset. If an assembly was adjourned for any
reason before all the* business on hand had been completed,

divisions voting as a unit.

To atone for the absence of deliberative assemblieS, con-
tiones, or meetings of the people‚ were called, and in these the
masses were enlightened upon matters of public policy. No
debate was allowed even here. The presiding officer addressed
the meeting himself, or indicated those who might do so·

factor in molding public opinion. It was in a contio that
