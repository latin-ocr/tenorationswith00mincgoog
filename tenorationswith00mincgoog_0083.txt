THE ROMAN CONSTITUTION 61

Every citizen had the righ‘t to bring suit in such caseS.
Many ambitious young men began their political career by
acting as public prosecutorS. One-fourth of the fine or of the
property confiscated was the reward 3 yet professional prosecu-
tion was forbidden by law. In the beginning of the trial the
prosecutor asked the presiding officer to allow the suit. If the
request was granted, the accused was summoned to appear,
and the jurors were selected. Every means to gain the jury
was admissible except bribery. After the taking of the testi-
mony and the pleading of the attorneys‚ the jurors voted
with A (absolvo), C (condemno), or N L (non liquet) ; and
fixed the punishment, which in early times consisted of either«
capital punishment or a fine not to exceed one-half of one's
property. At a later period the interdictio aquae et ignis, ac·
companied by confiscation of all property, took the place of
the death penalty. Since this interdictio cut off the guilty one
from all civic communion, it practically‘ compelled him to
leave the country.

VI. Religious OfficiaIS.—The ministers of the national re-
ligion were so intimately associated with public affairs that the
Roman state can hardly be understood without some note
being taken of their place in the national economy. Two col-
leges were of special importance.

The pontiffs (pontifices), fifteen in number, superintended
all religious observances and ceremonialS. The head of the
conlegium was the pontifex maximus, the most august dignitary
in the state. He was appointed by the college of pontiffs
from among their own number. His tenure of office was for
life. He selected the vestals and the flamens‚ directed mar-
riage and other family ceremonies‚ regulated the calendar, and
supen'ntended the observance of festivals, His influence was
very great, not only in religious matterS, but *also in matters
of civil life.

The augurS, originally three, finally fifteen in number, inter-

'trial and
Judgment.
