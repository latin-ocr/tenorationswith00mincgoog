2. Legati . . . superbius: in order to strengthen his argument,
Cicero gives an exceedingly mild version of this event. The states
of the Achaean league were at variance and had appealed to the
Roman senate, which decided that Sparta should be allowed to
withdraw from the league‚ and that other states should be required
to sever their connection with it. This decision was bitterly re·
sented. During the negotiations Roman envoys were driven out
of the assembly of the league amid shouts of derision. In the war
that followed, Corinth, the principal city of the league, was captured
and utterly destroyed in 146 13.c.

3. lumen: see note on lucem, p. 116, 1. 3.—exst:inctum: we
should expect exstinctam, as Corinthus is feminine, but occasionally
the predicate agrees with a noun in apposition ora noun contained in
a relative clause modifying the subject. Here the agreement of ex-
stinctum with lumen emphasizes the figure.
