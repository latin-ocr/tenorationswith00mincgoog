then consul with Augustus, to decree the destruction of Antony’s
statues and the eternal damnation of his name. The Nemesis

Cicero as a statesman. —Cicero’s character was far from a
simple one3 and though nineteen centuries have passed since
he labored and wrote, he is still, as he was in his own time, the

recipient of the most extravagant praise and the most violent
