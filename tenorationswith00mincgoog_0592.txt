MACMILLAN’S LATIN SERIES

ΟΟΜΜΕΝΤΞ

“The series is well planned. The Nepos of Mr. Barss sets a high
scholarly mark.’‘ '

J. P. Cosmus, Haud-master, Hillhouse High School,
New Haven, Coun.

“1 am sure it [Barss’ Nepos] will ronse high anticipations for the use-
fulness of your Latin SerieS. It is truly not ‘over-edited,'—a most ex-
cellent feature in a school text-book,- and it contains many things which
will assist the teacher in making a student think for himself ; and this,
after all, is the great object of all our teaching.”

CARthroN L. BROWNsoN‚ College of the City of New York.

“We have used the Nepos of the same series and found it most satis-
factory, and are greatly interested in the other publications. The Ovid
seems likely to reach the standard os excellence set by the Nepos. We
are pleased again to notice that the illustrations are not merely attractive,
but really throw some light on the text. The Introduction on metre is
very clear, and will be helpful to the studentS.’'

SUSAN BRALEY F RANKLIN, Miss Baldwin’s School, Bryn Mawr, Pa.

“We have used it [Barss’ Nepos] in connection with that imperfect
edition to which I referred before, and so far find nothing lacking in notes
or vocabulary. In every respect it seems to be an excellent edition, one
which we shall be likely to use in the future.''·

JOHN HYDE PECK, Principal of High School, West Hartford‚ Conn.

“It seems to me edited with good judgrnent‚ and it ought to prove a
useful and popular book. I shall be glad if it encourages teachers to read
Ovid more with their classeS.’'

WILLIAM C. COLLAR, Roxbury Latin School, Boston, Mass,

“This book [Bain’s Ovid], like the Nepos of the Macmillan Latin SerieS‚
seems to me very satisfactory. 1 waited for it some time last spring, and
shall now introduce it with great pleasure in my classes.”

JonN C. F LooD, St. Mark’s School, Southbor0‚ Mass·

“He examination of it [Bain's Ovid] has given me unusual pleasure,
for not only is the book a delight to the eye, but is well edited too. It is
the most attractive edition of Ovid with which I am acquainted.'’
