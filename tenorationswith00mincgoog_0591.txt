This edition, intended primarily for the use of sch0015‚ consists of about
three thousand verses with a complete commentary and about one thou·
sand verses for rapid reading, with brief notes at the bottom of the page.
Iu the belief that the Metamorphoses are best adapted for an introduction
to Latin verse, the selections therefrom, which form the greater part of
the book, are put first, and aie more fully annotated than the selections
from the other writings. The notes are concise and as few as possible for
elucidatingknotty points, Help is given not merely in explanation of
grammatical matters, but also in the interpretation of the myths, while
special attention is called to the force of the Latin word-order, and fre‘
quent aid is given for making a correct and fluent English rendering. As
aids to the study of verse, a brief summary of the general laws of prosody
is given in the introduction‚ together with copious exercises, and an long
vowels are indicated in the' earlier selectionS.
