THE LETTERS OF CICERO ‚45

refined and pure in thought and word, he is dearer perhaps
to our hearts with all his foibles than had he possessed all
the icy perfection of the ideal statue.

Their Style.—In style and language the letters necessarily
differ from the orationS. Neither rhetorical art nor deep
reflection determines here the choice of words or their position.
The language flows as from a natural spring, the learned armor
is laid aside, and the pen follows the dictation of the heart.
Popular terms and expressions from every-day language are
numerous, and frequent alliteration lends charm to the sound.
A harmless pun shows the writer's good nature 3 often an ellipsis
suggests rather than explains. Occasional epistolary tenses show
the politeness of the Roman, who places himself in the position
of the person addressed and in the time at which his message
will be read. Greek terms and quotations here and there
flatter the writer's vanity or help him in skillful periphrase.
Diminutives betray the tenderness of affection 3 and compounds
in per· and sub· convey degrees of emphasis not expressed by
the simple word.

Writing Materiale. —- For writing material the Romans em-
ployed in early times wooden or ivory tablets covered with wax
(tabellae) in which the letters were scratched by means of a
metal or ivory pencil (stilus). Only one side of these tablets
was written upon, and a raised wooden border protected the
writing when two or more of them were joined together. To
secure the privacy of the letter and to attest its genuineneSS, a
thread (linum) was passed around it and through holes in the
center, and the knot covered with wax which was stamped
(obszggrnare) with a signet-ring (anulus).

As early as 200 13.c. paper (charta) made of the Egyptian
papyrus was imported into Italy, and to a great extent the use
of the heavy wooden tablets was dispensed with. A reed pen
(calamus) took the place of the stilus,· the ink (atramentum)
