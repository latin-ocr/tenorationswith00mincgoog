IN CATILINAM QUARTA 301

14. qui . . . recusare: those who will not think it in keeping
witlz tlte dignity of tlzeir position to object to a measure which you
have determined upon in tlte interest of tlte common safety.

16. horribilis custodias: i.e. the municipia will guard them
closely because of the penalty just mentioned.

1 7. dignas: commensurate.

18. eorum: do not construe with quis ‚- but cf. quis eorum, l. 16.
—per senatum, per populum: i.e. by a decree of the senate, by
action of the comitia. Sallust (Cat. 51) makes Caesar propose that
any one initiating such legislation be declared by the senate a public
enemy.

19. spem . . . solet: Cf. Goldsmith‚ The Captivity‚ Act 11 :—

“ To the last moment of his breath‚
On hope the wretch relies;
And even the pang preceding death
Bids expectation rise.'’

23. in vita: ltere on earth.

24. illi antiqui: those men of old.

25. voluerunt: would have it. In expounding these teachings
os philosophy, Cicero is really endeavoring to counteract in some
degree the Roman repugnance to the death penalty. In his charac-
ter of orator and pleader, he never hesitates to adjust his beliefs as
well as the historical facts to the view he is maintaining at the time.
Compare the words with which he closes the first oration against
Catiline‚ aeternis suppliciis vivos mortuosque mactabis.

V. 27. mea: to be construed with intersit. A. 35 5. a; B.
211.1. a3 G. 3813 H. 449.1; W. 369. a.

28. in re publica: in politics.

29. habetur: used instead of est because Cicero does not wish
to acknowledge that the policy of the populares is really the course
which makes for the good of the people. See Introd.‚ p. 62.

30. hoc: i.e. Caesare—cognitore: in civil suits the represen-
tative who conducted the case in behalf of either plaintiff or defen-
dant was called cognitor. If the senate adopted Caesar's proposal,
the defense of the senate's action would devolve upon him.

31. illam alteram: i.e. sententiam Silani—nescio an: l am
inclined to think tlzat, a mild affirmation expressed‚ as often by
Cicem, in the form of an indirect question.

32. rationes: consideration.

33. vincat: outwetglz.·

2. amplitudo: Caesar belonged to one of the proudest patrician
