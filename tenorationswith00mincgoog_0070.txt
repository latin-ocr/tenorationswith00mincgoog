hordes of slaves had almost entirely supplanted the class of free
laborerS. Slaves had no rights whatever. In the eye of the
law they were mere chatte15‚ their lives being wholly subject to
the will of their masterS. Their wretched condition under the
republic led to numerous uprisingS, but they were given no legal
protection until the time of the empire.

classes ot There were at Rome two-privileged classeS‚ (1) the ordo

citizens. senatorius and (2) the ordo equester. Opposed to these was
the plebs or populus, the great mass of the citizens.

0¹0⁰ ἢ When after a struggle of more than two hundred years the

senatorius. old political distinctions between patricians and plebeians had
been swept away, an aristocracy of office replaced the old
patrician arist0cracy of birth. The senatorial order was now
practically a hereditary nobility‚ consisting of those whose
ancestors had held a curule magistracy, or who had themselves
attained to that distinction. Any free-born citizen might be-
come a candidate for office, but the opposition of the solid
phalanx of the nobility made it very difficult for a new man
(homo novus) to enter the political field. If he was elected
to a curule office, however. he thereby ennobled his posterity.
The members of the senatorial order were debarred from engag-
ing in any trade or business. The badge of the senators was
the tunic with a broad purple stripe (latus clavus).

ordo The knights (ordo equester or equites) owed their distinction

equester. entirely to a property qualification. Any free-born citizen
possessing a fortune of not less than 400,ooo sesterces (51 7,ooo)
was eligible to the order. The knights first received political
recognition from Gaius GracchuS, who gave them the right to
sit on juries‚ a privilege which previously had belonged exclu-
sively to the senators. From their number came the sarmers
of the revenue (publicani) and the large merchants and
capitalists (negotiatores).

Originally the equites formed a branch of the Roman army.

Under the Servian legislation eighteen centuries of the richest
men, most of thern young nobles, were organized as cavalry.
