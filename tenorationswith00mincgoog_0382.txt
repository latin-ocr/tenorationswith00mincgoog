at least morally responsible for its consequenceS, and by advocating
a poor measure might endanger his future political career. Gabinius
was exposed even to personal violence at the hands of the senators
who opposed his law.

5. honoris cauea nomino: a phrase employed in a reference to
persons of consequence still living, to -avoid any possible suspicion
that offense was meant by the mention of their names. Cf. Cic.
Rosc. A mer. 16. 47, Homines notos sumere odiosum est, cum et illud
incertum sit, velintne ii sese nominari. — plebi: this form of the
genitive instead of plebis is often found with tribunus.

6. anno proximo: we cannot now know whether this was perti-
nent. It would depend apparently upon whether the men he names
had during their tribuneship proposed the bills conferring imperium
upon those under whom they afterwards served as legati. , ,

7. eunt: i.e. the obtrectatores. — diligentes: scrupulous.

9. etiam . . . deberet: ought to have enjoyed even special privi-
lege53 or should have been a lautenant, and wmz peculiar justice.
ln the first interpretation, praecipuo iure is abl. of quality; in the
second, it is abl. of manner.

11. ego . . . relaturum: as praetor Cicero had the right to
lay such a proposal before the senate3 but a consul, praetor, or
tribunus plebis could by his veto prevent its enactment into law.
The consuIS, moreover, could by decree (inimicum edictum) pre·
vent the consideration of any question not on the calendar.

12. quo minus defendam: A. 558. ‚b3 B. 295. 3; G. 5493
H. 568. 83 W. 514.—vestrum ius beneficiumque: i.e. the rzgrlet
and favor the people had conferred upon Pompey by granting him
the power to choose his own legati under the Gabinian law.

13. praeter intercessionem: the right of veto was seldom exer-
cised in the senate save by the tribuneS, and their intercessio could
not be lightly disregarded.

15. quid liceat: howfar they can go.

17. ascribitur: is joined. For Cicero's real opinion of Gabinius»,
see Introd.‚ p. 9. — alter, uni: tlte one, the otker. Um· is used in-
stead of alteri for the sake of variety.

XX. 21. quaereret: Q. Catulus spoke in a contio against the
Gabinian law.

22. si quid eo factum esset: z's anythingslzould hoppen to him.
Sallust has the equivalent expression si in Pompeio quid humani

evenisset. See the note on sz' quid obtzgerit‚ p. 112, l. 6. For the
construction of eo, see A. 403. c; Β. 218. 63 G. 401. N. 73 H·
