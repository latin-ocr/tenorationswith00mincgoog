IN CATILINAM PRIMA 269

the fallen to crime.”-ferrum . . . praetulisti: as slaves (armi-
geri and lanternarii) were wont to do for their masters.

2. Quid vero ε introduces a still stronger argument.

3. vacuefecisses : nowhere do we find Cicero's charge that Cati-
line murdered his first wife substantiated. Cicero probably voiced
the rumors of current gossip.

4. alio scelere: when Catiline desired to marry Aurelia Orestilla,
a widow of great beauty and much wealth, but of bad reputation, she
objected to his suit because of his son by a former marriage. The
boy died suddenly, and gossip accused the father of poisoning him.
Cicero simply alludes to this rumor; Sallust deemed it quite worthy
of belief ς Valerius Maximus, finally, mentions it· as a fact— an

excellent illustration of Vergil's well-known saying in reference to
gossip, vimis· adquirit eundo.

5. facile patior: gladly allow.

8. Idibus: the Ides and the Calends were the regular days for
the payment of interest and the settlement of accounts.

10. difficultatem: i.e. financial embarrassment.—aummam rem
publicam ε equivalent to summam rei publicae salutem.

1. pridie . . . paravisse: accounts differ as to the circumstances
of this so·called first conspiracy. Cicero here indicates that the
slaughter had been set for the last day of the year 66 13.c.‚ to take
place in the Forum (stetu-se in comitio cum telo), where the outgoing
consuIS, M'. Aemilius Lepidus and L. Volcatius TulluS, were to make
their farewell addresses to the people in a contio. According to Sal-
lust, however, the attack was to be made on Jan. 1, 65 B.C., in the
Capitol, where the new consuls, L. Aurelius Cotta and L. Manlius
Torquatus, would be inaugurated. But no matter which date or
place is correct, it is certain that the plot was not carried out on
the date originally agreed upon because it had become known, and
its execution was ‚fixed for a meeting of the senate, Feb. 5. The evil
designs of the conspirators were again frustrated, as Catiline gave the
s³gna1 before a sufficient number of armed men had assembled.

3. comitio: see map‚ p. 75.—cum telo: in spite of the fact
that neque in comitium neque in forum neque in curiam ferre telum
fasfuit.

4 non . . . tuum: no change of purpose and no sear on your

7.l issa: explained by the following quotiens . . . effugi.— non
mu ta: few.

9. petitiones, ita coniectae: thrusts, so aimed ,· an expression
descriptive of a gladiatorial combat. The figure is still further car-

raon
