IN CATILINAM TERTIA 2 87

8. multos fortis: et is omitted because fortis joins with viros to
denote a single conception. —praefeetura Reatina: Reate was an
ancient town of the Sabines in central Italy. That Cicero selected
his men from among the citizens of Reate is explained by the fact
that he was the patron of their town and could trust their loyalty. A
praefectura was an Italian town or community originally governed
by a Roman official (praefectus iuri dicundo). After all Italians
had obtained the full Roman citizenship, the term praefectura, as
well as the names municipium and colonia, continued to exist only
as a historica] reminiscence.

10. tertia fere vigilia: i.e. about three o'clock in the morning.

14. nota solis: Sallust (Cat. 45) states that the AllobrogeS, cito
cognito consilio, at once surrendered: and (Cat. 41 and 44) that
they were acting under Cicero's instructions and aiding him to
obtain evidence against the conspirators. They may not have been
fiilly cognizant of his plans, and perhaps their forcible arrest may
have been intended to cover their treachery to the conspirators.

111. 16. sedatur: historical present. So also traduntur and
deducuntur below.

17. integris signis: see Introd.‚ p. 45.

19. Cimbrum Gabinium: Sallust (Cat. 17) gives his name as
P. Gabinius Capito. Cicero appears to regard Gabinius as the
author of the plan to tamper with the Allobroges (horum . . .
machinatorem). Notice that when the praenomen is omitted, the
cognomen may precede the nomen.

20. suspicantem: modifies Gabinium.

21. Ιι. Statilius: a Roman knight. — C. Cethegus: C. Cor-
nelius CetheguS‚ a senator.

22. in litteris dandis: writing letters. The sat-casm of this
remark is fully appreciated when we notice the length of the letter

quoted on p. 102, l. 11 ff.

23. vigilaret: the ironical use of eredo is parenthetical‚ and so
does not affect the mood.

25- prius quam deferri: we should expect deferrentur, but
deferri is used to continue the construction of aperiri.

27. negavi . . . ut non deferrem: afuller and stronger expres-
sion for dixi me esse delaturum. Trans. l said that I would not act
in such a way that in a matter involving danger to tlte state I could
not lay tlte facts unprejudiced before tlte council os state.

29. si: equivalent to etiam si, as often when the main clause is
negative.

31. nimiam diligentiam: tlte reproach of being over careful.
