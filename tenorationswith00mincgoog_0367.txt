Philip V of Macedon and Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, were
both brought into conflict with Rome by their attacks upon Perga-
mus and the RhodianS, allies of the Roman people. Philip was
defeated at Cynoscephalae in 197 13.c., and Antiochus at Magnesia
in 190 B.c. The Aetolian league had joined Antiochus against Rome.

11. belli . . . dignitatem: cf. p. 125, 1. 21.

15· sed etiam metus: this is sound financial reasoning. War

from the fact that the number of cattle had to be registered (scribere)
