MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO 7

saved this city and this state.” “ You speak true,” the assem-
bly cried, and repeated the oath after him. But the attack had
began, and that too from a quarter which justified the most
serious alarm.' For Metellus Nepos was scarcely more than
the tool of Pompey‚ whose inordinate vanity was injured in that
the conspiracy had been crushed without his aid. The marked
coldness and restraint which he displayed toward Cicero during
this period increased the boldness of the latter's enemies.

Then came the unfortunate affair with P. Clodius Pulcher. Clodius.

That profligate scion of a noble house was detected while pro· ⁶² B'c'
faning with his presence the celebration of the mysteries of the
Bona Dea, from which all men were most rigorously excluded.
The offense was of so sacrilegious a nature that he was brought
to trial by a special decree of the senate. His defense sought
to establish an alibi, which was overthrown by Cicero's testi-
mony. The jury was bribed and Clodius was acquitted‚ but
thenceforward he was Cicero’s unrelenting enemy.

In the year 60 13.c. Caesar, Pompey‚ and Crassus formed the 'rue First

coalition known as the first triumvirate. Overtures were made {ongigyirate
to Cicero to join thern, but he had no sympathy with their
unlawful ambitions‚ and preferred to retain his independence.
The power of the senatorial party was now finally broken.
Caesar was elected consul and later secured the two Gallic
provinces for a term of five years. Pompey's acts in Asia were
ratified, and the agrarian law which settled his Asiatic veterans
in Campania was passed. Cicero refused to serve on the
commission to allot the Campanian landS, thus offending both
the mob and the triumvirS. His enemies were now in the
ascendency. Against him were arrayed the friends of Crassus
among the knightS‚ the friends of Catiline and Clodius among
the nobility‚ the mass of the populares, and the three who stood
at the head of the state.

Clodius, who by means of his adoption into a plebeian family
had secured the tribuneship‚ seized the opportunity presented, Exue

and proposed in 58 13.c. that whoever had put to death a 58 nc.
