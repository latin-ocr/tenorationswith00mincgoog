danger appointed a dictator, who held supreme power for a

term of not more than six months, With the other extraordi- κ

nary magistrateS, he possessed the imperium, or military power.
From his decisions there was no appeal. The office gradually
fell into disuse‚ the last dictator being appointed in 202 B.C.
The so-called dictatorships of Caesar and Sulla were not con-

. stitutional, but usurpations of monarchical power. The in-

signia of a dictator were the sella curulis, the toga praetexta,
and an attendance of twenty—four lictors,

The master of horse (magister equitum) was appointed by

that time a new king had not been elected, the interrex named
a successor to himself and withdrew from the magistracy.
This course was continued until a king was chosen. In the
same way an interrex was appointed by the senate during the
republic in case of a vacancy in the chief magistracy caused
by the death or resignation of the consuls.

After the expulsion of the kingS, the supreme executive
power was vested in two consuIS‚ who until 366 B.C. were
chosen from the patricians only. In the later republic the
executive power was shared to a large extent with other magis-
trates, The consuls took precedence over all other magistrates
in convoking the senate, and executed its decreeS. They
presided over the comitia during the election of curule magis-
trates, Within the city their power was limited by the ius

city they possessed supreme civil, judicial, and military author-
