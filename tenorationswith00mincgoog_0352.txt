PAGE in Gaul, whither Catiline had sent his agents (transcendit
ua Διρίβ),

1v. 27. D. Silani: D. Junius SilanuS, who as consul elect spoke
first.

29. C. Caesaris: Gaius Julius Caesar, at this time praetor elect,
was already a recognized leader of the democratic party. He was
even accused by his enemies among the optimates of favoring that
lawless element in Rome which was represented in the person of
Catiline. It was therefore not to have been expected that he would
object openly to any rigor in the punishment of those whose sinister
designs he was suspected of having abetted. The fact that he spoke
in favor of only such penalties as were provided by the laws does great
credit not only to his natural courage and clemency‚ but also to the
political sagacity which foresaw the reaction that would inevitably fol·
low any infringement of law, and his own consequent popularity as
defender of the constitutional rights of the people. A strange para-
dox it seems that Cicero, who gave up his life· in behalf of a con-
stitutional government, should in this case have used his influence for
the subversion of the laws; while the man who was afterward to
overthrow the government acted as their defender. Of Caesar's actual
complicity in the conspiracy there exists no proof whatever, and it is l
certainly not in accordance with the astuteness he showed in other
matters to suppose that he could have allowed himself to be involved 1
in it.

of tlte utmost severity. — pro: in accordance with, as was to be ex·

4. saepe esse usurpatum: lzas qften been resorted ta, a state·
ment not in accordance with historical factS.

10. singularem poenam: penal imprisonment was resorted to ³
by the Romans only in rare instances. A citizen could usually l
avoid sentence of death by going into exile, and this was also in
Cicero's time the usual penalty imposed upon criminals by the courts. 1
