DE IMPERIO POMPEI , 333

XXIII. 16. quem: the indefinite promum-conlatis signis:
when battle has been joined.

22. pacatam fuisse: has been considered subdued. The mean-
ing is that a country was treated as hostile so long as it gave oppor-

tunity for plunder.

23. istis: men of that strtjhe, the contemptuous use of the word.

28. classium nomine: with their so-called fleets. The money
that should have been spent for the equipment and maintenance of
their fleets had been diverted by the commanders to their own pri-
vate useS, and hence the ships were so inadequate and inefficient as
to be almost useless for wan—detrimentis accipiendis: abl. of
cause. We might have had acceptis here, but the gerundive is used
more exactly to take the place of the missing present passive par-
ticiple.

29. cupiditate: i.e. eagerness for the wealth to be gained from
a province, in which lay their only hope of averting financial ruin.

30. iacturis: expendz'tureS‚ to secure their election to office and
subsequent appointment to a rich province—condicionibus: i.e.
the arrangements, often on the most unfavorable terms‚ which they
were obliged to make with their creditors before it was possible for
them to set out.

33. alienis vitiis: by contrast with tlte failings os others. —
videamus: A. 5243 B. 307. 1. 23 G. 6023 H. 584. 2: W. 567.

1. nolite dubitare: A. 4503 B. 276. ος G. 271. 23 H. 561. ¹3
W. 496.—-quin credatis! see note on p. 142, l. 35.—inter: in
tlte course of.

5. omnium: i.e. omnium generum.

6. P. Servilius: Ρ. Servilius Vatia Isauricus rendered valuable
services against the pirates during the years 78-75 13.c. The relief
gained, however, was but temporary. The four men mentioned in
this sentence were all of consular rank.

8. C. Curio: C. Scribonius CuriO, consul in 76 13.c. and after-
wards governor of Macedonia, was the first Roman commander to
lead an army to the Danube. As he enjoyed some reputation as a
speaker, Cicero mentions his ingenium—summis . . . praeditus:
a case of zeugma. With beneficiis and rebus gestie some such
word as ornatus would be more appropriate3 but cf. p. 151, ll. 10, 1 1.

10. Cn. Lentulus: Cn. Cornelius Lentulus ClodianuS, one of
Pompey's lieutenants in the war with the pirateS.

12. C. Cassius: C. Cassius Longinus VaruS, consul in 73 B.C, ’

and governor of Cisalpine Gaul in 72 B.C., suffered there a defeat at
the hands of Spartacus.
