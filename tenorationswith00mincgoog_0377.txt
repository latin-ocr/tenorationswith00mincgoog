as a soldier may have been, Pompey could lay but little claim to

enemy fearlessly3 in civil life he was a shy man, whose cheek flushed
on the slightest occasion3 he spoke in public not without embar-
rassment, and generally was angular‚ stiff‚ and awkward in in-
tercourse” (Mommsen). Cicero says of him that he might have
attained greater fame as a speaker, had ambition not drawn him to
the career of a soldier: and praises his common sense, the clear·
ness of his voice, and the dignity of his gestures,
