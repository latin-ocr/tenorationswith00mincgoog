wonderfully moved him, and proceeded in his speech with such

varied pathos and such charm of language that the cfflor of

Caesar's -countenance often changed, and it was evident that

all the passions of his soul were in commotion. At length, the

orator touching upon the battle of PharsaluS, he was so affected

THE LETTERS OF CICERO

Their Discovery and Number. —Of Cicero’s extensive corre-
spondence about 870 letters have come down to our time,
among these 98 letters addressed to him. When interest in
Roman literature died away after the fall of the Western Roman
Empire, the correspondence was forgotten and the letters were
finally lost. Their rediscovery we largely owe to F rancesco
Petrarca, the Italian poet and scholar, who in 1345 A.D. found
at Verona the letters to Atticus, Quintus Cicer0, and Brutus,
Toward the end of the same century the letters ad familiares
were discovered at Vercelli. At present we possess the following The extant
collections : Ad Familiares, sixteen books ; Ad Atticum, sixteen 0⁰¹¹⁰⁰t¹⁰¹¹⁸·
books 3 Ad Quintum Fratrem, three books 3 Ad Brutum, two
books, These letters cover the period from 68 to 43 13.c.‚ the
last having been written but a few months before Cicero's death.
None from the year of his consulship are extant. The 14th
book aa' familiares addressed to Terentia by her husband, and
to their children, has been selected for this edition.
