Their Interest.—Correspondence was of much greater im
portance to the Romans than to us because their letters con-
tained to some extent the information furnished to us by
newspaperS. In them the news from the provinces was brought
to the statesman and financier at the capital, and the Roman
by their means sent word of what took place in the city to his
friends living permanently or stationed temporarily in the
various parts of the empire. For two reasons Cicero's letters
are of special importance and interest to us, Of this kind of
literature they are the only considerable example extant from
ancient timeS. They naturally show us the tendency of the
times and the character of men from a point of view entirely
different from that of orations, historical workS, or philosophical

ξζξιιξῇῗξὲ ⁰¹ in one of his letters to Atticm, to edit his correspondence and
place it before the publio, his life's work was ended before he
succeeded in doing this. AtticuS, his closest friend, made a

we see his vanity3 his deceitfulness toward men whom he
hateS, yet professes to love 3 his sarcastic malice toward those
from whom he differs 3 his fickleness and irresolution. Now he
sinks into the depth of despair, thinking even of suicide ; now
again he swims on the crest of the billow apparently carrying
,him to his goal, the recognized leadership of the Roman state.

Yet his weaknesses are but human, his virtues far beyond the
average of his time. A faithful husband, a loving father, an
honest steward wherever his country placed him, a scholar
